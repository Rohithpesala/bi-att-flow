Best Answer: Notochord is the skeletal rod which lies lengthwise between the central nervous system and the alimentary canal or the gut and the chordates possess it at young stage of development.

Mix violet and yellow and it makes lighter brown. For a really warm brown i mix orange and violet. You have to experiment a little using different amounts until you get the color you want. Best Answer: Complimentary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. When mixed together they make brown. Essentially the 3 primary colors are red, yellow, blue. 2 primary colors mixed together make a secondary color. These are red+yellow=orange, blue+yellow=green, red+blue=violet. On a color wheel, find a color and look exactly opposite that color and that will be the compliment. Example blue is opposite orange. The short answer is: Mixing blue and orange makes a great brown.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution.

A side chain is also linked to this carbon, and that's what varies between amino acids: it can vary in its composition, charge, length...

Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans. In both types of therapy, scientists need something to transport either the entire gene or a recombinant DNA to the cell's nucleus, where the chromosomes and DNA reside. In essence, vectors are molecular delivery trucks. Somatic gene therapy introduces therapeutic genes at the tissue or cellular level to treat a specific individual. Germ-line gene therapy inserts genes into reproductive cells or possibly into embryos to correct genetic defects that could be passed on to future generations. RNA editing is relatively rare, and common forms of RNA processing (e.g. splicing, 5'- capping and 3'- polyadenylation) are not usually included as editing. Editing events may include the insertion, deletion, and base substitution of nucleotides within the edited RNA molecule. RNA editing has been observed in some tRNA, rRNA, mRNA or miRNA molecules of eukaryotes and their viruses, archaea and prokaryotes. NHEJ uses a variety of enzymes to directly join the DNA ends in a double-strand break.

A switching diode is most often used to turn a circuit on or off, and band switching diodes are used for switching high frequency band signals. The simplest possible circuit for converting AC into DC is a half-wave rectifier. This circuit consists of a single diode that only allows current to flow in one direction. A possible circuit is shown below in figure 4. In this figure, you'll find the AC power source connected to the primary side of a transformer.

The first period being from Nero in 64 to the end of the reign of Maximinus in 238. The second period extending from the Decian persecution of 249 through to the signing of the 'Edict of Milan' in 313. {5} It has been calculated that between the first persecution under Nero in 64 to the Edict of Milan in 313, Christians experienced 129 years of persecution and 120 years of toleration and peace.

Gluconeogenesis Definition. The literal meaning of Gluconeogenesis is GLUCO \u2013 glucose; NEO \u2013 new; GENESIS \u2013 creation. Thus Gluconeogenesis is a biochemical term that describes the synthesis of glucose or glycogen from substances which are not carbohydrates. Basically Gluconeogenesis is the reversal of Glycolysis which is the process of breaking down of glucose to produce energy. [ 1 ]Glycolysis proceeds to another energy cycle called Citric acid cycle by forming a substance called pyruvate. So, Gluconeogenesis is just the reversal of Glycolysis \u2013 starting with pyruvate. In humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a part of the triacylglycerol molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis. 1 The final reaction of gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase to produce glucose and release an inorganic phosphate. gluconeogenesis.

Sound originates from the vibrations that result after an object applies a force to another object. Interesting Sound Energy Facts: The intensity of sound energy is usually measured using the perception of a normal hearing person. The measurement of sound energy is related to its pressure and intensity. We are able to hear different sound because as the sound (vibrations) enters our ear, the ear also vibrates. Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When any object vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. These particles bump into the particles close to them, which makes them vibrate too causing them to bump into more air particles. The definition of sound says that it is a disturbance of energy that comes through matter as a wave, and that humans perceive sound by the sense of hearing. Sound pressure is the effect and sound power (energy) is the cause. But our eardrums are only sensitive to the sound pressure, and so are microphone diaphragms. The energy in a sound wave is both kinetic and potential. Just as in a vibrating spring, the medium has mass a \u2026 nd moves and so moving mass is kinetic energy. Just as in the spring there is compression and rarefaction, so there is elastic potential energy. Sound energy is produced when an object vibrates.

Those compounds with a carbon atom are called organic compounds, due to their root base in an atom that is vital for life. There are a small number of inorganic compounds that actually do contain carbon, given its propensity for forming molecular bonds; these include carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, to name a few. Inorganic compounds are often quite simple, as they do not form the complex molecular bonds that carbon makes possible. All organic compounds contain carbon; however, there are some compounds of carbon that are not classified as organic. For example, salts such as carbonates (e.g., Na 2 CO 3, CaCO 3) and cyanides (e.g., NaCN, KCN) are usually designated as inorganic.

After all, the planet Earth is almost 8,000 miles in diameter, so the magnetic field has to travel a long way to affect your compass. That is why a compass needs to have a lightweight magnet and a frictionless bearing. Let\u2019s take a look at the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The Earth is like a great big magnet. The north pole of the magnet is near the top of the planet, near the geographic north pole, and the south pole is near the geographic south pole. Magnetic field lines extend from these poles for tens of thousands of kilometers into space; this is the Earth\u2019s magneto sphere. Dangerous particles don't hit the Earth's surface because they are forced by the magnetic field to move around the Earth. Particles do enter at the funnels over the poles or they gain entry far downstream from the Earth. The particles that enter downstream or at the magnetotail cause the auroral lights. The Earth has a magnetic field with north and south poles. The Earth's magnetic field reaches 36,000 miles into space. The magnetic field of the Earth is surrounded in a region called the magnetosphere. It does seem clear that the generation of the magnetic field is linked to the rotation of the earth, since Venus with a similar iron-core composition but a 243 Earth-day rotation period does not have a measurable magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from huge blasts of deadly solar radiation, has been weakening over the past six months, according to data collected by a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite array called Swarm.
