In mechanics, the normal force is the component, perpendicular to the surface (surface being a plane) of contact, of the contact force exerted on an object by, for example, the surface of a floor or wall, preventing the object to fall. The strength of the force can be calculated as: where N is the normal force, m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational field strength, and \u03b8 is the angle of the inclined surface measured from the horizontal.

It is also known as a squawker. A mid-range driver is called upon to handle the most significant part of the audible sound spectrum, the region where the most fundamentals emitted by musical instruments and, most importantly, the human voice, lie. Best Answer: In a two-way system there is a woofer and tweeter that together produce the range of frequencies. In a three-way system a mid-range speaker produces a mid-range of frequencies. This places less burden on the woofer and tweeter, typically reducing distortion. However a carefully designed crossover network is normally required for good results. The audio spectrum is the audible frequency range at which humans can hear. The range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and can be effectively broken down into seven different frequency bands, with each having a different impact on the total sound. Midrange: 500 Hz to 2 kHz. The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue.

In transpiration, water travels from the soil into the roots of plants, and up to the underside of plant leaves, where it is released into the air.

However, fatty acids have to be activated for degradation by coenzyme A by forming a fatty acyl-CoA thioester. For short and medium length fatty acids, they undergo this reaction in the mitochondria. In biochemistry and metabolism, beta-oxidation is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are co-enzymes used in the electron transport chain. Answers. Best Answer: Beta oxidation is the process by which fatty acids, in the form of Acyl-CoA molecules, are broken down in mitochondria and/or in peroxisomes to generate Acetyl-CoA, the entry molecule for the Citric Acid cycle. The beta oxidation of fatty acids involve three stages: 1. Top 10 facts about the world. Beta-oxidation is a metabolic process whereby fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-CoA.

Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to rise the temperature of 1 kg mass by 1 degree Celsius. Answers. Best Answer: specific heat capacity is the heat energy that is required to change the temperature of a unit quantity of a substance by a certain temperature interval. The heat capacity of a substance is a measure of how well the substance stores heat. Whenever we supply heat to a material, it will necessarily cause an increase in the material's temperature. The heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required per unit increase in temperature On the other hand, specific heat capacity, also referred to as the specific heat of a material, is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of an object per unit mass of that object. From these definitions, we can see that thermal capacity is an extensive property. (Answer #1). Thermal capacity, also referred to as heat capacity, is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of an object by a certain degree. Eg. The specific heat capacity of water \u2026 is 4.18 joules per gram. So you need to transfer 4.18 joules of energy to one gram of water in order to raise it by one degree K Temperature on the other hand is the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.

This process is called the retrogradation of starch. This example shows the measurement of bread. Tweet. When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. Bread that was initially soft and moist becomes progressively harder and dry. Starch retrogradation can be temporarily reversed by reheating loaves of bread in the oven or individual slices in the toaster. Reheating brings the bread back up to the gelatinization temperature and causes the molecules to reabsorb some moisture. However, there is a way that this process can be reversed-at least temporarily... During baking, starch molecules in the raw bread dough begin to gelatinize at about 150\u00b0, meaning they absorb moisture, swell, and then become semi-firm. Chemical modification of starches can reduce or enhance the retrogradation. Waxy, high amylopectin, starches have also much lesser tendency to retrogradate. Additives such as fat, glucose, sodium nitrate and emulsifier can reduce retrogradation of starch. The linear chains place themselves parallel and form hydrogen bridges.

Punctuation is not the only factor influencing a reader\u2019s pace, but it is an important influence. tonivaver/iStock/Getty Images. Although a poem's punctuation can take any form desired by the author, there are a few guidelines to help along those who are unsure. There are six basic forms of punctuation used in a poem: period, semicolon, comma, question mark, exclamation point and dash. Use a question mark or exclamation point for major emphasis. In poetry, these are some of the least often used punctuation marks, meaning they should be used only for special occasions. Insert a dash when you need a pause that requires more emphasis than a comma but does not require a full stop. A mark of punctuation that comes within the line itself is called a caesura. Caesuras cause the reader to pause or stop in the middle of a line, providing a clear break in thought or slowing the pace of the poem. Some poets omit punctuation or use it minimally.
