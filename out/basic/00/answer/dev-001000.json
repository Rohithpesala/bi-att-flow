After Joseph Henry discovered electric induction in 1831, enabling further development in electrical telegraphy, the first practical telegraph was invented by Dr. David Alter of Elderton, Pennsylvania, in 1836. One reason for the success of Morse's system was that it could be operated over a single wire of lesser quality, and over a long distance. Telegraph wires were strung along railroad lines in many areas. Introduction. Developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse (1791-1872) and other inventors, the telegraph revolutionized long-distance communication. It worked by transmitting electrical signals over a wire laid between stations. In 1853, Julius Wilhelm Gintl in Vienna, Austria discovered a way to send two telegraph messages in opposite directions down the same wire. This technology was not commercially successful until 1871, when it was improved by the duplex system of inventor J. B. Stearns. Within a year or two, Western Union and other telegraph companies were using diplex telegraphs on their busiest lines in major cities. In 1874, Thomas Edison invented the first quadruplex telegraph, which was capable of sending two messages simultaneously in each direction. In 1809, a crude telegraph was invented in Bavaria by Samuel Soemmering.

Coagulase is an enzyme produced by S. aureus that converts (soluble) fibrinogen in plasma to (insoluble) fibrin. Staphylococcus aureus produces two forms of coagulase, bound and free. Slide Coagulase Test Procedure. 1 Take a clean grease free and dry glass slide. 2 Place a drop of plasma. 3 Place a drop of distilled water or saline next to the drop of plasma as a negative control. 4 Emulsify a portion of the isolated colony being tested in each drop, and make a smooth milky suspension (not clumpy). The coagulase tube test has been set up as a demo for you to observe in class. This version of the coagulase test is used to identify the presence of either bound coagulase or free coagulase, which is an extracellular enzyme. Free coagulase reacts with a component of plasma called coagulase-reacting factor. The result is to cause the plasma to coagulate. In the demo, the coagulase plasma has been inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and allowed to incubate at 37\u02daC for 24 hours. Bound coagulase reacts with the fibrinogen in plasma, causing the fibrinogen to precipitate. This causes the cells to agglutinate, or clump together, which creates the \u201clumpy\u201d look of a positive coagulase slide test. However it is now known that not all S. aureus are coagulase-positive. It is also produced by Yersinia pestis. Coagulase reacts with prothrombin in the blood.

Ionic bond: bond in which one or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, resulting in positive and negative ions which attract each other. Other types of bonds include metallic bonds and hydrogen bonding. So instead the two atoms share 1 or more pairs of electrons, 1 from each atom, each bond being made of one pair of electrons. As the energy levels involved are the valency electrons, and as the two atoms 'co-operate' as it were, this kind of bond is called a covalent bond.

If you haven't read the page about the mechanism of the reaction, you may wonder why collision 2 won't work as well. The double bond has a high concentration of negative charge around it due to the electrons in the bonds. Thus, the proportion of collisions that can overcome the activation energy for the reaction increases with temperature. The only way to explain the relationship between temperature and the rate of a reaction is to assume that the rate constant depends on the temperature at which the reaction is run. Catalysts increase the rates of reactions by providing a new mechanism that has a smaller activation energy, as shown in the figure below.

A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes. 1 For example, the disorder sickle cell anaemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that instructs the building of a protein called haemoglobin. 2 This causes the red blood cells to become an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape. 3 However, in African populations, having this mutation also protects against malaria. What is a mutation? A mutation is a change that occurs in our DNA sequence, either due to mistakes when the DNA is copied or as the result of environmental factors such as UV light and cigarette smoke. A chromosome mutation is an unpredictable change that occurs in a chromosome.

It is a type of mechanical wave which means it requires an object to travel through. This object includes air and water. Sound originates from the vibrations that result after an object applies a force to another object. Interesting Sound Energy Facts: The intensity of sound energy is usually measured using the perception of a normal hearing person. The measurement of sound energy is related to its pressure and intensity. We are able to hear different sound because as the sound (vibrations) enters our ear, the ear also vibrates. Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When any object vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. These particles bump into the particles close to them, which makes them vibrate too causing them to bump into more air particles. The definition of sound says that it is a disturbance of energy that comes through matter as a wave, and that humans perceive sound by the sense of hearing. Sound pressure is the effect and sound power (energy) is the cause. But our eardrums are only sensitive to the sound pressure, and so are microphone diaphragms. The energy in a sound wave is both kinetic and potential. Just as in a vibrating spring, the medium has mass a \u2026 nd moves and so moving mass is kinetic energy. Just as in the spring there is compression and rarefaction, so there is elastic potential energy. Sound energy is produced when an object vibrates. The sound vibrations cause waves of pressure that travel through a medium, such as air, water, wood or metal. Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy. Sound energy is a form of energy associated with the vibration or disturbance of matter. The SI unit of sound energy is the joule (J).

Anaerobic respiration produces a lower yield of ATP in the absence of oxygen. When the body needs energy more quickly than it can absorb oxygen, such as during a sprint, cells use anaerobic respiration to produce ATP quickly This ATP production by the mitochondria is done by the process of respiration, which in essence is the use of oxygen in a process which generates energy. This is a very efficient process for using food energy to make ATP. One of the benefits of aerobic exercise is that it improves your body's ability to make ATP rapidly using the respiration process.

Species richness, very simply, is a count of the different species in a given ecosystem, region or particular area. You make the assumption that each organism constitutes a single species. Species richness is a count of the number of species in a given habitat or ecosystem. Unlike species diversity, species richness does not take species abundance into account.

The more species present in a sample, the 'richer' the sample. Species richness as a measure on its own takes no account of the number of individuals of each species present. Both samples have the same richness (3 species) and the same total number of individuals (1000). However, the first sample has more evenness than the second.

Rutherford discovered nitrogen by the isolation of the particle in 1772. When Joseph Black was studying the properties of carbon dioxide, he found that a candle would not burn in it. Black turned this problem over to his student at the time, Rutherford.

For example, the strong acid HCl gives up all its protons to water: Weak bases exist in chemical equilibrium much in the same way as weak acids do, with a base dissociation constant (Kb) indicating the strength of the base. For example, when ammonia is put in water, the following equilibrium is set up: Bases that have a large K b will ionize more completely and are thus stronger bases.

During hemostasis, the injured blood vessel constricts to reduce blood flow, platelets adhere to the injury site and clump (aggregate) together to form a loose platelet plug, and the coagulation cascade is initiated. Blood clotting (technically blood coagulation ) is the process by which (liquid) blood is transformed into a solid state. This blood clotting is a complex process involving many clotting factors (incl. calcium ions, enzymes, platelets, damaged tissues) activating each other. On the surface of these activated platelets, many different clotting factors work together in a series of complex chemical reactions (known as the coagulation cascade) to form a fibrin clot.
