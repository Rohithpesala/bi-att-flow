It is caused by a cha nge or mutation in the gene for the blood clotting protein called prothrombin (which is also called Factor II). People with the prothrombin gene mutation have higher than normal levels of prothrombin in their blood, making them prone to blood clots, most common in the veins. People who have prothrombin mutation G20210A have a 2-to-3 fold increase in the risk of DVT. Persons who have this mutation plus the Factor V Leiden mutation have a 10-to-20 fold increase in thrombotic risk. Prothrombin mutations have also been linked with thrombotic events other than DVT, including recurrent miscarriage (repeat spontaneous abortions). It raises the risk of thrombosis significantly for both males and females in all age groups.

It lies between the dorsal nerve tube and the gut. It increases locomotory power and internal support. Best Answer: Notochord is the skeletal rod which lies lengthwise between the central nervous system and the alimentary canal or the gut and the chordates possess it at young stage of development. In adult vertebrates, it is replaced by vertebral column. On the other hand a nerve cord is a solid strand of nervous tissue, forming part of central nervous system, especially of invertebrates.

Best Answer: Complimentary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. When mixed together they make brown.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution. For the future, many think a better way of making biofuels will be from grasses and saplings, which contain more cellulose.

With the patient under general anesthesia, a gastrectomy is performed, and the appropriate branches of the vagus nerve are excised. Introduction to the Vagus Nerve.

Description and Significance. Zooxanthellae species are members of the phylum Dinoflagellata. However, this is not a taxonomic name. Instead, it refers to a variety of species that form symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms, particularly coral. The most common genus is Symbiodinium. Not all Zooxanthellae are endosymbionts; some are free-living. Symbiodinium are colloquially called zooxanthellae (or zoox ), and animals symbiotic with algae in this genus are said to be zooxanthellate. The term was loosely used to refer to any golden-brown endosymbionts, including diatoms and other dinoflagellates. Just as in their free-living relatives, zooxanthellae need to live in the sunlight, so they are usually found in those parts of animals, such as the skin, which are in the sunlight.

The results of mineral concentration are two main products: the concentrate and tailings. In some cases (for example, in the concentration of asbestos or anthracite), the concentrates differ from the tailings mainly in the size of mineral particles. Ores containing minerals that undergo changes at high temperatures\u2014for example, loss of water of crystallization or CO2, changes in magnetic susceptibility or density, or cracking\u2014may be prepared for subsequent concentration by roasting. Crushing, a form of comminution, one of the unit operations of mineral processing. In the field of extractive metallurgy, mineral engineering, mineral processing, also known as mineral dressing or ore dressing, is the process of separating commercially valuable minerals from their ores. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue. Copper-Most copper ore bodies are mined from minerals created by weathering of the primary copper ore mineral chalcopyrite. Minerals in the enriched zone include chalcocite, bornite, djurleite.

When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. This process is called the retrogradation of starch. This example shows the measurement of bread. Tweet. When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. Bread that was initially soft and moist becomes progressively harder and dry. Starch retrogradation can be temporarily reversed by reheating loaves of bread in the oven or individual slices in the toaster. Reheating brings the bread back up to the gelatinization temperature and causes the molecules to reabsorb some moisture. However, there is a way that this process can be reversed-at least temporarily... During baking, starch molecules in the raw bread dough begin to gelatinize at about 150\u00b0, meaning they absorb moisture, swell, and then become semi-firm. Chemical modification of starches can reduce or enhance the retrogradation. Waxy, high amylopectin, starches have also much lesser tendency to retrogradate. Additives such as fat, glucose, sodium nitrate and emulsifier can reduce retrogradation of starch. The linear chains place themselves parallel and form hydrogen bridges.
