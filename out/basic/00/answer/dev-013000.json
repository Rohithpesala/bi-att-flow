Some of the everyday things that we use today are Renaissance inventions and technology. Both the microscope and the telescope were invented during the Renaissance. This was due to improvements in making lenses. These improved lenses also helped with making eyeglasses, which would be needed with the invention of the printing press and more people reading. Many of the great scientific discoveries made during the Renaissance were in the area of astronomy. Great scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler all made major contributions. This was such a big subject that we devoted an entire page to it. Learn more about it at our page on Renaissance Astronomy. Many of the world's most ground-breaking inventions came out of Renaissance Europe. The years between the late 14th and early 17th centuries were characterised by imagination, experimentation and change in the schools of science, design and engineering. This chapter will focus on three of the most significant inventions of the Renaissance period in Europe: the printing press, the telescope and the caravel. Each of these three inventions, along with the smaller, yet equally useful devices and contraptions that they inspired, changed the course of history. The most important invention of the Renaissance, and perhaps in the history of the world, was the printing press. It was invented by German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440. By 1500 there were printing presses throughout Europe. Many of the great scientific discoveries made during the Renaissance were in the area of astronomy.

Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in large numbers of red blood cells being destroyed, which leads to anemia. Alpha thalassemia occurs when there is a problem with the alpha-globin part of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia occurs when there is a problem with the beta-globin part of hemoglobin. There are both mild and severe forms of alpha and beta thalassemia. Severe beta thalassemia is often called Cooley's anemia.

It is also known as a squawker. A mid-range driver is called upon to handle the most significant part of the audible sound spectrum, the region where the most fundamentals emitted by musical instruments and, most importantly, the human voice, lie. Best Answer: In a two-way system there is a woofer and tweeter that together produce the range of frequencies. In a three-way system a mid-range speaker produces a mid-range of frequencies. This places less burden on the woofer and tweeter, typically reducing distortion. However a carefully designed crossover network is normally required for good results. The audio spectrum is the audible frequency range at which humans can hear. The range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and can be effectively broken down into seven different frequency bands, with each having a different impact on the total sound. Midrange: 500 Hz to 2 kHz. The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue. The Mid Range The Mid Range band of frequencies covers two octaves from 500 Hz to 2 kHz. This range can give a horn-like quality to instruments (500 Hz to 1 kHz) and a tinny sound (1 kHz to 2 kHz) or a telephone-like quality (all of the range).

This puzzle was solved by Peter D. Mitchell with the publication of the chemiosmotic theory in 1961. Now consider the reaction of glucose + Pi to form glucose-6-P.

Primary succession is the initial movement of simple organisms, known as pioneer species, into new habitats that have been created.

Primary succession is the colonization of new sites by communities of organisms. It often occurs after a devastating event has wiped out the organisms that lived in the area, or with the creation of a new habitat. Definition of Primary Succession. Primary succession is the colonization of new sites by communities of organisms. It often occurs after a devastating event has wiped out the organisms that lived in the area, or with the creation of a new habitat. Let's look at a couple examples to see how primary succession occurs. Again, for a period of time, no living organisms may exist in the area. Before long, however, certain types of plants begin to reappear. And, as with primary succession, the nature of the plant communities gradually change over time. Succession is the process by which new community gets established at an area which had been uninhabited.", "14901": "is a type of unglazed, white porcelain, with a matte appearance and texture to the touch.", "14903": "The Empire State Building is a skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City, USA.", "16081": "unique 17 or 15 digit code used to identify an individual mobile station to a GSM or UMTS network.", "14908": "40\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F.", "19412": "to eight minutes.", "14912": "Multiplying that by the depth gives the volume in cubic feet.

After all, the planet Earth is almost 8,000 miles in diameter, so the magnetic field has to travel a long way to affect your compass. That is why a compass needs to have a lightweight magnet and a frictionless bearing. Let\u2019s take a look at the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The Earth is like a great big magnet. The north pole of the magnet is near the top of the planet, near the geographic north pole, and the south pole is near the geographic south pole. Magnetic field lines extend from these poles for tens of thousands of kilometers into space; this is the Earth\u2019s magneto sphere. Dangerous particles don't hit the Earth's surface because they are forced by the magnetic field to move around the Earth. Particles do enter at the funnels over the poles or they gain entry far downstream from the Earth. The particles that enter downstream or at the magnetotail cause the auroral lights. The Earth has a magnetic field with north and south poles. The Earth's magnetic field reaches 36,000 miles into space. The magnetic field of the Earth is surrounded in a region called the magnetosphere. It does seem clear that the generation of the magnetic field is linked to the rotation of the earth, since Venus with a similar iron-core composition but a 243 Earth-day rotation period does not have a measurable magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from huge blasts of deadly solar radiation, has been weakening over the past six months, according to data collected by a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite array called Swarm.
