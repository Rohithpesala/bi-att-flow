Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation which, like visible light or infrared, make up a portion of the entire spectrum. They cannot be perceived by human eyes or ears, and they are not harmful in the environment.

Beta thalassemia occurs when there is a problem with the beta-globin part of hemoglobin. There are both mild and severe forms of alpha and beta thalassemia. Severe beta thalassemia is often called Cooley's anemia. Thalassemia is an inherited disorder that affects the production of normal hemoglobin (a type of iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the tissues of the body).", "16685": "place where nails are made.", "16687": "Negri bodies (29).", "16689": "An ancestral allele or an ancestral trait (depending on whether you look at the phenotype or a t the genotype) is the trait/allele that was carried by the common ancestor of the taxon you consider.", "16690": "the carotid sinus and in the aortic arch.", "16691": "The ascending system is connected to cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and also the thalamus.

PROTHROMBIN GENE MUTATION Prothrombin gene mutation is the second most common cause of inherited thrombophilia in the United States. It is present in about 2% of Caucasians. It is caused by a cha nge or mutation in the gene for the blood clotting protein called prothrombin (which is also called Factor II). People with the prothrombin gene mutation have higher than normal levels of prothrombin in their blood, making them prone to blood clots, most common in the veins. People who have prothrombin mutation G20210A have a 2-to-3 fold increase in the risk of DVT. Persons who have this mutation plus the Factor V Leiden mutation have a 10-to-20 fold increase in thrombotic risk. Prothrombin mutations have also been linked with thrombotic events other than DVT, including recurrent miscarriage (repeat spontaneous abortions).

They are also neighboring planets. However, Venus and Earth are also very different. Venus has an atmosphere that is about 100 times thicker than Earth's and has surface temperatures that are extremely hot. Venus does not have life or water oceans like Earth does. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: There are typically two planets that are dubbed as Earth's twin. The first one, Venus, is called Earth's twin because of its similar size, and how it is the closest planet to Earth. But, scientists discovered that Venus's atmosphere and temperature were totally different from Earth's. The other planet also called Earth's twin is Mars. Mars is believed to have a large ocean on the past. Some even say that life may have developed on Mars for a short period of time. the closest thing in our solar system to a double planet is Pluto-Charon, since they have a barycenter outside the two bodies. however, they are no longer considered planets. \u2026 Some people call Neptune and Uranus twin planets", "18117": "ligaments attaching the muscle to the You do not have access to view this node.", "18118": "good source of calcium, magnesium, and iron.", "18119": "is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language.", "18120": "is the copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate.

Heat stroke is perhaps one of the most common causes of heavy dog panting that can lead to devastating damage to the dog's physical health. If a dog is left in a parked car on a hot summer day, or has been out playing or running for a long time in the heat, he can easily get heat stroke.

Dogs tend to pant a great deal. Because they don't sweat the way humans do, panting is their way of cooling down when they are overheated, in a particularly warm climate, after exerting themselves. This is not, however, the only reason why dogs pant. Panting is also an important way for dogs to oxygenate their blood. Medication. Some medications, such as prednisone, may also lead to heavy panting in dogs. Talk to your veterinarian if you think your dog\u2019s medication is causing heavy panting.

Transpiration also includes a process called guttation, which is the loss of water in liquid form from the uninjured leaf or stem of the plant, principally through water stomata. Studies have revealed that about 10 percent of the moisture found in the atmosphere is released by plants through transpiration. Transpiration is the loss of water from plants in the form of vapor (evaporation). Plants utilize most of the water absorbed from the soil for transpiration (95%), but a small portion of the water absorbed is used during photosynthesis for producing the carbohydrates necessary for plant growth (5%). Transpiration and plant leaves. Plants put down roots into the soil to draw water and nutrients up into the stems and leaves. Some of this water is returned to the air by transpiration (when combined with evaporation, the total process is known as evapotranspiration). PLANT PARAMETERS \u2013 These plant parameters help plants control rates of transpiration by serving as forms of resistance to water movement out of the plant. Stomata \u2013 Stomata are pores in the leaf that allow gas exchange where water vapor leaves the plant and carbon dioxide enters. In transpiration, water travels from the soil into the roots of plants, and up to the underside of plant leaves, where it is released into the air. This evaporation of water from plants into the atmosphere happens thanks to small pores in the leaves called stomates. Transpiration is the process of water loss from plants through stomata. Stomata are small openings found on the underside of leaves that are connected to vascular plant tissues.

Some are naturally occurring toxins that are found in certain foods, and others are produced by bacteria that have contaminated a food item. Bacteria generate toxins which can be classified as either exotoxins or endotoxins. Exotoxins are generated and actively secreted; endotoxins remain part of the bacteria. Usually, an endotoxin is part of the bacterial outer membrane, and it is not released until the bacterium is killed by the immune system. Microbial toxins promote infection and disease by directly damaging host tissues and by disabling the immune system.

It is a type of mechanical wave which means it requires an object to travel through. This object includes air and water. Sound originates from the vibrations that result after an object applies a force to another object. Interesting Sound Energy Facts: The intensity of sound energy is usually measured using the perception of a normal hearing person. The measurement of sound energy is related to its pressure and intensity. We are able to hear different sound because as the sound (vibrations) enters our ear, the ear also vibrates. Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When any object vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. These particles bump into the particles close to them, which makes them vibrate too causing them to bump into more air particles. The definition of sound says that it is a disturbance of energy that comes through matter as a wave, and that humans perceive sound by the sense of hearing. Sound pressure is the effect and sound power (energy) is the cause. But our eardrums are only sensitive to the sound pressure, and so are microphone diaphragms. The energy in a sound wave is both kinetic and potential. Just as in a vibrating spring, the medium has mass a \u2026 nd moves and so moving mass is kinetic energy. Just as in the spring there is compression and rarefaction, so there is elastic potential energy. Sound energy is produced when an object vibrates. The sound vibrations cause waves of pressure that travel through a medium, such as air, water, wood or metal. Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy.

For another twenty years, the mechanism by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive high-energy intermediate that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. This puzzle was solved by Peter D. Mitchell with the publication of the chemiosmotic theory in 1961. Now consider the reaction of glucose + Pi to form glucose-6-P. In this reaction a phosphoester is formed, so the reaction would proceed with a positive D Go = 3.3. Now if ATP was used to transfer the terminal (gamma) phosphate to glucose to form Glc-6-P, the reaction proceeds with a D Go = -4 kcal/mol. The linkage between oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the phosphorylation of ADP by 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate can be artificially uncoupled by adding arsenate, which has a similar structure as phosphate. oxidative phosphorylation the final common pathway of aerobic energy metabolism in which high-energy phosphate bonds are formed by phosphorylation of ADP to ATP coupled with the transfer of electrons along a chain of carrier proteins with molecular oxygen as the final acceptor.

When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. This process is called the retrogradation of starch. This example shows the measurement of bread. Tweet. When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. Bread that was initially soft and moist becomes progressively harder and dry. Starch retrogradation can be temporarily reversed by reheating loaves of bread in the oven or individual slices in the toaster. Reheating brings the bread back up to the gelatinization temperature and causes the molecules to reabsorb some moisture. However, there is a way that this process can be reversed-at least temporarily... During baking, starch molecules in the raw bread dough begin to gelatinize at about 150\u00b0, meaning they absorb moisture, swell, and then become semi-firm. Chemical modification of starches can reduce or enhance the retrogradation. Waxy, high amylopectin, starches have also much lesser tendency to retrogradate. Additives such as fat, glucose, sodium nitrate and emulsifier can reduce retrogradation of starch. The linear chains place themselves parallel and form hydrogen bridges. In viscous solutions the viscosity increases to form a gel. At temperatures between \u20138 and +8 \u00b0C the aging process is enhanced drastically.

It is one of the only arteries (other than the umbilical arteries in the fetus) that carries deoxygenated blood.

It is short and wide\u2014approximately 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length and 3 centimetres (1.2 in) in diameter. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Types of arteries and veins. There are two types of arteries in the body: Pulmonary and systemic. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart, to the lungs, for purification while the systemic arteries form a network of arteries that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body. Arteries carry oxygenated blood (with the exception of the pulmonary artery and umbilical artery). Veins carry deoxygenated blood (with the exception of pulmonary veins and umbilical vein). Arteries carry blood away from the heart. Pulmonary arteries transport blood that has a low oxygen content from the right ventricle to the lungs. Systemic arteries transport oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body tissues. One system, the pulmonary vessels, transports blood from the right ventricle to the lungs and back to the left atrium. The other system, the systemic vessels, carries blood from the left ventricle to the tissues in all parts of the body and then returns the blood to the right atrium. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.

Primary succession is the initial movement of simple organisms, known as pioneer species, into new habitats that have been created. Typically, these new areas of colonization have been made available through major geological events, such as volcanoes and earthquakes. Primary succession is the colonization of new sites by communities of organisms. It often occurs after a devastating event has wiped out the organisms that lived in the area, or with the creation of a new habitat. Definition of Primary Succession. Primary succession is the colonization of new sites by communities of organisms. It often occurs after a devastating event has wiped out the organisms that lived in the area, or with the creation of a new habitat. Let's look at a couple examples to see how primary succession occurs. Again, for a period of time, no living organisms may exist in the area. Before long, however, certain types of plants begin to reappear. And, as with primary succession, the nature of the plant communities gradually change over time. Succession is the process by which new community gets established at an area which had been uninhabited. The community which gets established at the site is called climax community.", "14901": "is a type of unglazed, white porcelain, with a matte appearance and texture to the touch.

Actin is a spherical protein that forms filaments, which are involved in muscle contraction and other important cellular processes. Tropomyosin is a long strand that loops around the actin chains in the thin filament. Troponin is a protein that helps hold tropomyosin in place on the actin filament. A muscle contraction consists of a series of repeated events. First, calcium triggers a change in the shape of troponin and reveals the myosin-binding sites of actin beneath tropomyosin Below are two different but similar descriptions of muscle contraction that explain the processes involved in notification, contraction, and relaxation. The following steps are involved in muscle contraction: (2) A motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord is activated, and an action potential passes outward in a ventral root of the spinal cord. (3) The axon branches to supply a number of muscle fibers called a motor unit, and the action potential is conveyed to a motor end plate on each muscle fiber.
