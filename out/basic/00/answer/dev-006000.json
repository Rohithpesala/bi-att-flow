Although the accounting costs are very important to company owners, the economists are mainly focused on economic costs rather than accounting costs. Example is attending College(Economic Cost=accounting cost + opportunity cost): The opportunity cost is the are the four years paycheck you can earn if you weren't in school. -The accounting cost is the tuition, books, housing, food,, and other miscellaneous things your owing now. The opportunity cost is the activity you give up. Economic cost is what it actually costs to make something. For example, if I am making cars, I have to pay for the steel, fabric, fittings, plus pay my workers and, perhaps, advertising, shipping, distribution, &c. These are economic costs.

Best Answer: Notochord is the skeletal rod which lies lengthwise between the central nervous system and the alimentary canal or the gut and the chordates possess it at young stage of development.

This is a very interesting question. There are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. To start, the type of food matters. Some foods are more complex, requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them.

This is mainly because of other ingredients used. For example, flour has ph value of 5.5-6.5. Too much baking powder can cause the batter to be bitter tasting. It can also cause the batter to rise rapidly and then collapse. (i.e. The air bubbles in the batter grow too large and break causing the batter to fall.) Cakes will have a coarse, fragile crumb with a fallen center. Both baking powder and baking soda are chemical leavening agents that cause batters to rise when baked. The leavener enlarges the bubbles which are already present in the batter produced through creaming of ingredients. Make sure to bake the batter immediately. Baking soda has an indefinite shelf life if stored in a sealed container in a cool dry place. Too much baking soda will result in a soapy taste with a coarse, open crumb.

In some texts, the interquartile range is defined differently. It is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in the middle 50% of a set of data. To compute an interquartile range using this definition, first remove observations from the lower quartile. Then, remove observations from the upper quartile. Then, from the remaining observations, compute the difference between the largest and smallest values. Q3 is the middle value in the second half of the data set. Again, since the second half of the data set has an even number of observations, the middle value is the average of the two middle values; that is, Q3 = (6 + 7)/2 or Q3 = 6.5.

There are numerous diverse forms of lupus. The most common type of lupus is SLE or systemic lupus erythematosus. The manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus as well include inflammation of the kidneys, loss of appetite, fatigue, and hair loss. Likewise, the origin of rheumatoid arthritis is still not known. The condition can attack the knees, wrists, feet, fingers, and ankle Lupus vs Rheumatoid Arthritis. Both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus arthritis affect the peripheral joints. Both present with pain, swelling, and stiffness, and both arthritis have systemic manifestations. Though they present with similar symptoms, clinically rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are different. You may also be interested in reading: 1. Difference Between Gout and Arthritis. 2.

(August 2012) Although lupus usually occurs alone, many people with lupus sometimes have symptoms characteristic of one or more of the other connective tissue diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, and various forms of vasculitis. The differentiation between someone who has rheumatoid-like arthritis and lupus vs. someone who has rheumatoid arthritis/SLE overlap is either an issue of severity of the findings or more likely a matter of semantics with no significant clinical difference. Rheumatoid Arthritis is the most common autoimmune disease in the world. It is basically a disease which causes weakness and it causes many of the symptoms like joint pain and joint destruction in some cases that one sees in Lupus.", "11913": "The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the body from the environment.

An electric motor converts electrical power to mechanical power in its rotor. There are several ways to supply power to the rotor. In a DC motor this power is supplied to the armature directly from a DC source. But in an AC motor this power is induced in the rotating device. An induction motor can be called a rotating transformer because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. These 10 facts about space will blow your mind. An induction motor is a motor that provides power. It owes its name to the way it operates. Alternating current (AC) voltages are induced by the magnetic and rotating field of the stator in the rotor circuit. An induction motor is constructed with elements of copper, steel, and aluminum. While this makes them more expensive than universal motors, it also increases their quality and durability. An induction or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. Since rotation at synchronous speed would result in no induced rotor current, an induction motor always operates slower than synchronous speed. The difference, or slip, between actual and synchronous speed varies from about 0.5 to 5.0% for standard Design B torque curve induction motors.

For a home you described the range is about $200.00 per square foot. The other variables are of course location, quality of work and amenities Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial. Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100.

Another type of hernia, called a ventral hernia, occurs in the midline of the abdomen, usually above the navel (umbilicus). This type of hernia is usually painless. Hernias can also occur within the navel (umbilical hernia) A hernia is the exit of an organ, such as the bowel, through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides. Hernias come in a number of different types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral. By far the most common hernias develop in the abdomen, when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole, or defect, through which adipose tissue, or abdominal organs covered with peritoneum, may protrude. Another common hernia involves the spinal discs and causes sciatica. There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal (next to the esophagus). In a sliding hiatal hernia, the stomach and the section of the esophagus that joins the stomach slide up into the chest through the hiatus. This is the more common type of hernia.
