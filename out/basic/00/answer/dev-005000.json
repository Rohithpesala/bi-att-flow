For David Harvey, the crisis of representation has to do with the dematerialization and the shifting of a central value system (1990, p. 298). He speaks about the changing experience of space and time, of sign systems, and of the ways in which money and commodities have become the bearers of cultural codes.

Inherited means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. Acquired means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia isn't known. In general, a low platelet count occurs because: 1 The body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets. 2 The bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up. 3 The spleen holds on to too many platelets A low platelet count is often assumed to be ITP (immune thrombocytopenia). However, there are many other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, with clinical severity ranging from trivial to life threatening. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can only be diagnosed after all other causes of low platelets are ruled out. When thrombocytopenia is severe (a platelet count less than 20-30,000/microliter), and other obvious causes are ruled out, many doctors administer the first-line treatments for ITP: prednisone, anti-D, IVIG. A rapid response to these therapies supports the diagnosis of ITP. Many people who have large platelets also have a reduced platelet count.

The article that follows explores the history of persecution of the early church, some of the reasons behind it, and two important Christian responses to persecution: the glorification of martyrdom and the writings of the apologists.

He suggests that we should be prepared to face similar trials as our culture becomes less tolerant of true Christian faith. The persecution of the early Church may be viewed as two distinct periods. The first period being from Nero in 64 to the end of the reign of Maximinus in 238. The second period extending from the Decian persecution of 249 through to the signing of the 'Edict of Milan' in 313. {5} It has been calculated that between the first persecution under Nero in 64 to the Edict of Milan in 313, Christians experienced 129 years of persecution and 120 years of toleration and peace.

Here's a look at what exactly saltpeter is. Answer: Saltpeter is the natural mineral source of the chemical potassium nitrate, KNO 3. Depending where you live, it may be spelled 'saltpetre' rather than 'saltpeter'. Before systematic naming of chemicals, saltpeter was called nitrate of potash. It has also been called 'Chinese salt' or 'Chinese snow'. Sodium nitrate, also called salt peter, shares many applications with potassium nitrate. Both can be used to manufacture nitric acid, to propel model rockets, and to increase the shelf life of meats and other foods. Sodium nitrate is also used to manufacture glass and enamel. Salt peter is also used as a fertilizer and as a stump remover, as it accelerates the decomposition process of tree stumps. Salt peter can be found in many everyday products as well. It is used to preserve some foods, most commonly meats, although there are concerns about its health effects. While it is difficult to find saltpeter, you can still purchase potassium nitrate, which is used to make smoke bombs and certain other fireworks, as 'stump remover'. In the United States, you can find it at Lowes or Home Depot, among other places. Salt peter typically refers to the chemical compound potassium nitrate, though it may also refer to sodium nitrate. Salt peter was once collected from decomposing material, but today, it is generally manufactured by treating sodium nitrate, mostly mined in Chile, with potassium chloride and collecting the precipitate.

These are small plants generally lacking a true vascular tissue (xylem and phloem). Nonvascular plants, also known as bryophytes, are green seedless plants that date back more than 400 million years. There are three types: mosses (Division Bryophyta), liverworts (Division Hepatophyta) and hornworts (Division Anthocerophyta). Each can reproduce asexually or sexually. The plant kingdom consists of four major groups: the nonvascular plants, the seedless vascular plants, the gymnosperms and the angiosperms. The nonvascular plants, such as mosses and liverworts, are one of the simplest groups of the true plants. Plants, which do not have vascular systems are called non vascular plants or lower plants. These plants do not contain xylem or phloem tissues. But they have special tissues for translocation of water. Bryophytes, including liverworts, mosses, and hornworts belong to non vascular plant group. Nonvascular plants are commonly found in moist environments so that they are always close to a water source and can absorb the water right into the main part of the plant without relying on roots. Nonvascular plants also differ from vascular plants based on their reproductive strategies. Living groups of nonvascular plants include the bryophytes: liverworts, hornworts, and mosses.

The name sherm was originally coined from, people dipping Nat Sherman cigarettes into liquid PCP. PCP comes as either a white powder or liquid form, the latter given the street name embalming fluid.. There is much confusion over the practice of dipping cigarettes in embalming fluid leading some to think that real embalming fluid may actually be used. A cigarette dipped in PCP. An organic solvent such as formaldhyde maybe used to extract the PCP, thereby making it available for dipping repeatedly. Smoking embalming fluid, sherming, all refer to the PCP high.

It consists of a head and a tail region. Together, the tails of approximately three hundred myosin molecules form the shaft of the thick filament. In summary, myosin is a motor protein most notably involved in muscle contraction. Actin is a spherical protein that forms filaments, which are involved in muscle contraction and other important cellular processes. Tropomyosin is a long strand that loops around the actin chains in the thin filament. Troponin is a protein that helps hold tropomyosin in place on the actin filament. A muscle contraction consists of a series of repeated events. First, calcium triggers a change in the shape of troponin and reveals the myosin-binding sites of actin beneath tropomyosin Below are two different but similar descriptions of muscle contraction that explain the processes involved in notification, contraction, and relaxation. The following steps are involved in muscle contraction: (2) A motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord is activated, and an action potential passes outward in a ventral root of the spinal cord. (3) The axon branches to supply a number of muscle fibers called a motor unit, and the action potential is conveyed to a motor end plate on each muscle fiber. Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position.
