Adenine is joined to Thymine by 2 H-bonds. Cytosine is joined to Guanine by 3 H-bonds. There are two types of atomic bonds-ionic bonds and covalent bonds. They differ in their structure and properties. Covalent bonds consist of pairs of electrons shared by two atoms, and bind the atoms in a fixed orientation. Relatively high energies are required to break them (50 - 200 kcal/mol). Covalent bond: bond in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms. Ionic bond: bond in which one or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, resulting in positive and negative ions which attract each other. Other types of bonds include metallic bonds and hydrogen bonding. So instead the two atoms share 1 or more pairs of electrons, 1 from each atom, each bond being made of one pair of electrons. As the energy levels involved are the valency electrons, and as the two atoms 'co-operate' as it were, this kind of bond is called a covalent bond.

Longitudinal waves, also known as l-waves, are waves in which the displacement of the medium is in the same direction as, or the opposite direction to, the direction of travel of the wave. In longitudinal waves, the displacement of the medium is parallel to the propagation of the wave. A wave along the length of a stretched Slinky toy, where the distance between coils increases and decreases, is a good visualization. Sound waves in air are longitudinal, pressure waves. See information on P waves. Transverse Wave s. A transverse wave is a wave in which the motion of the medium is a right angles to the direction of the wave. A wave on a rope is a transverse wave.

There are some options when it comes to finishing a basement, and they all come with a cost. If you choose a basic do-it-yourself makeover, including adding moisture control, framing in walls and adding decor and furnishings, your cost will run between $10,000 and $27,000. Expect this type of basement to cost more at least $65,000. A basement finishing system is another option, running $45,000 to $55,000. These out-of-the-box systems include everything from moisture-proof, insulated wall panels to ceilings to lighting. 1 Adding a basement to an existing house can cost $30,000-$70,000 or more, depending on the size of the existing crawlspace or half-basement or if the house is on a slab foundation, and how much of the work is do-it-yourself and how much is done by contractors.

Studies suggest that the psyllium in Metamucil works differently. The psyllium fiber in Metamucil forms a viscous gel that traps some bile acids (made from cholesterol) and gently removes them from your body. This gel also traps some carbohydrates and sugars, allowing them to be more slowly absorbed by the body. Psyllium is a form of fiber made from the Plantago ovata plant, specifically from the husks of the plant\u2019s seed. It sometimes goes by the name ispaghula. It\u2019s most commonly known as a laxative. Psyllium provides more benefits to your body than decreasing the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. Numerous studies have shown that fiber like psyllium, as part of a healthy diet, can help lower a person\u2019s risk of heart disease. Psyllium can affect your heart by lowering blood pressure, improving lipid levels, and strengthening heart muscle. The soluble fiber found in psyllium husks can help lower cholesterol.

Psyllium has also been used to help regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Overview.

Redwoods help create their own microclimate through the transpiration of moisture from the leaves to the atmosphere. A very large redwood can release up to 500 gallons of water a day into the air. Redwood is a rapidly growing tree, and some individual trees have been measured at more than 360 feet in height, making it the tallest measured tree species on the earth. In favorable situations, trees 20 years old may average 50 feet in height and 8 inches in diameter. Average mature trees are from 200 to 240 feet high with diameters of 10 to 15 feet at 4 feet 8 inches above the ground. Exceptional individuals sometimes reach a height of 350 feet, a diameter of over 20 feet, and an age of approximately 2000 years. Redwood leaves are green, flat, and sharp-pointed. Redwood, also known as Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), grows in a very narrow strip along the coast of California from the extreme southwestern corner of Oregon to 150 miles south of San Francisco in the Soda Springs drainage of Big Sur. The coast may receive 122 inches of rain per year.

Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans. In both types of therapy, scientists need something to transport either the entire gene or a recombinant DNA to the cell's nucleus, where the chromosomes and DNA reside. In essence, vectors are molecular delivery trucks. Somatic gene therapy introduces therapeutic genes at the tissue or cellular level to treat a specific individual. Germ-line gene therapy inserts genes into reproductive cells or possibly into embryos to correct genetic defects that could be passed on to future generations. RNA editing is relatively rare, and common forms of RNA processing (e.g. splicing, 5'- capping and 3'- polyadenylation) are not usually included as editing. Editing events may include the insertion, deletion, and base substitution of nucleotides within the edited RNA molecule. RNA editing has been observed in some tRNA, rRNA, mRNA or miRNA molecules of eukaryotes and their viruses, archaea and prokaryotes. NHEJ uses a variety of enzymes to directly join the DNA ends in a double-strand break. In contrast, in HDR, a homologous sequence is utilized as a template for regeneration of missing DNA sequence at the break point. The natural properties of these pathways form the very basis of nucleases based genome editing. Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans.

Like all cells, they are unbelievably complicated in their own right. The Types and Function of Neurons. The nervous system consists of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), the peripheral nervous system (the sensory and motor neurons), and the autonomic nervous system (which regulates body processes such as digestion and heart rate). Neurons communicate through an electrochemical process. Sensory receptors interact with stimuli such as light, sound, temperature, and pain which is transformed into a code that is carried to the brain by a chain of neurons. The behavioral effects of alcohol are produced through its actions on the central nervous system (CNS) and, in particular, the brain. Synaptic transmission\u2014the process by which neurons in the CNS communicate with one another\u2014is a particular target for alcohol actions that alter behavior. How Do Neurons Communicate. When a signal is sent, a neurotransmitter is activated. The neurotransmitter is an chemical compound that is sent from neuron to neuron when information is being transmitted. The neurotransmitter is stored in vessicles in the axon of the neuron. Motor (and other output) neurons: Motor neurons contract muscles and mediate behavior, and other output neurons stimulate glands and organs.
