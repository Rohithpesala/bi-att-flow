Beta thalassemia occurs when there is a problem with the beta-globin part of hemoglobin. There are both mild and severe forms of alpha and beta thalassemia.

Unconformity is the general term for missing pages of Earth history. There are three types of unconformities (below): angular unconformity, nonconformity, and disconformity.

When mixed together they make brown. Essentially the 3 primary colors are red, yellow, blue. 2 primary colors mixed together make a secondary color. These are red+yellow=orange, blue+yellow=green, red+blue=violet. On a color wheel, find a color and look exactly opposite that color and that will be the compliment. Example blue is opposite orange.

It causes overall muscle weakness and developmental delay leading to severe mental disability. Canavan disease is caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called aspartoacylase. This enzyme breaks down a material called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. Without enough enzyme, the NAA builds up in the brain and destroys its white matter. Canavan disease is a rare inherited disorder that damages the ability of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain to send and receive messages. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies disrupt the growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Canavan disease is a progressive, fatal neurological disorder that begins in infancy. It is caused by an inherited genetic abnormality: the lack of an essential enzyme causes deterioration of the white matter (myelin) in the brain, thereby preventing the proper transmission of nerve signals.

The other factors affected hurricane activity on short time scales only. A rise in the world's sea surface temperatures was the primary contributor to the formation of stronger hurricanes since 1970, a new study reports. In the tropical oceans, the sea surface temperature (SST) is much warmer than that of the deeper water below the surface. In an ocean layer called the thermocline, the transition from warm water to cold water occurs rapidly. While the sea surface cools in response to this evaporation, the magnitude of the cooling is generally small compared to the cooling that results from other processes caused by the hurricane\u2019s surface winds. To understand these other processes, it is necessary to look beneath the sea surface. This eventually causes rotation of the storm mass and you get a tropical cyclone.

Projective identification is often experienced not as an isolated incident, but as a series of [[[projection]]s and identifications and counter-projections and counter-identifications that evolve in a relationship over time. An example of this might be the mother/infant dyad or a husband and wife pairing. Projective identification functions as a mode of communication as well. The first person gives his or her unwanted thoughts or feelings to the second person. Instead of communicating these thoughts or feelings with words, the unwanted content is given directly Most of these desires are based on pure, uncontrolled instinct. In this example, your actions are controlled by the id. According to Freud, the id is the biological component of our personality which is present at birth and based on instinct. In Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic view, the personality consists of three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.", "11281": "24 hours for skin cells to die.

This ratio is then compared to a population of people with similar chronological The studies identified an association between telomere length and a gene variant called rs12696304 on the chromosome 3q26. The researchers say that possessing the variant is associated with a person having a shorter average telomere length that equates to about 3.6 years of age-related telomere shortening. The telomeres found at the ends of chromosomes shorten with age. Genetic tests to determine how quickly a person will age may soon be available, according to several newspapers. The news is based on the recent discovery of a genetic variation that apparently predisposes some people to faster ageing. Baird et al. (48) described single-telomere length analysis as a viable platform for measuring telomere length in 2003. Single-telomere-length analysis was developed to measure the telomere length of single chromosomes to investigate whether individual critically short telomeres influenced cell senescence. Consequently, yeast cells are more amenable to studies of telomere structure and dynamics. Telomeres in inbred mice are much longer (20,000\u2013150,000 base pairs) than telomeres in humans, and mice have a higher baseline expression of telomerase (1, 10). Telomere Length has been proposed as a marker for biological aging of the cardiovascular system.

Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Recent accumulating evidence suggests that the human immune system possesses a variety of innate receptors that recognize, distinguish, and respond to viral infections and to vaccination. Virus infection in vertebrates results in two general types of immune response. The first is a rapid-onset innate response against the virus, which involves the synthesis of proteins called interferons and the stimulation of natural killer lymphocytes. Adaptive immune defenses. The immune response to viral infection comprises innate and adaptive defenses. The innate response, which we have discussed previously, functions continuously in a normal host without exposure to any virus. Most viral infections are controlled by the innate immune system. A key feature of the adaptive immune system is memory. Repeat infections by the same virus are met immediately with a strong and specific response that usually effectively stops the infection with less reliance on the innate system. When we say we are immune to infection with a virus, we are talking about immune memory. 1 In the effector phase of the adaptive immune response, secretory antibodies prevent infection at mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, while circulating antibodies diffuse to and protect the lungs. 2 Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) contribute to elimination of the infection by lysing virus-infected cells.", "13262": "disease or disorder that is inherited genetically.", "13263": "group of four muscles located in the buttocks and lateral hip region on both sides of the body.", "10403": "$50 to $125 per hour", "13268": "C$41,580 per year.", "13269": "American rock", "13135": "6,000", "13277": "microscopic organism that can carry disease other words used for germs are microorganisms microbes and in slang bugs the term generally refers to bacteria or viruses it could also include fungi or protozoa it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment many of the tests used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor are also used for staging the following tests and procedures may also be used for staging pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body germ cell tumors can spread metastasize to other parts of the body the most common sites for metastasis are the lungs liver lymph nodes and central nervous system rarely germ cell tumors can spread to the bone bone marrow and other organs ovarian germ cell tumor is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the germ egg cells of the ovary germ cell tumors begin in the reproductive cells egg or sperm of the body ovarian germ cell tumors usually occur in teenage girls or young women and most often affect just one ovary germ cell tumors are malignant cancerous or nonmalignant benign noncancerous tumors that are comprised mostly of germ cells germ cells are the cells that develop in the embryo fetus or unborn baby and become the cells that make up the reproductive system in males and females ovarian germ cell tumor is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the germ egg cells of the ovary signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the abdomen or vaginal", "13278": "30 minutes to one hour.

However, for the past 100 years or so, geologists have agreed, based on a robust data corpus, that the Grand Canyon is probably five to six million years old, even though the rock from which it is carved is up to two billion years old. 1 The top layer of the Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Limestone, contains many marine fossils which indicate that it originated at the bottom of the sea. 2 This layer is around 250 million years old. 3 Rock layers younger than 250 million years have been eroded away and no longer exist in the immediate vicinity of the Grand Canyon. 1 This layer is around 250 million years old. 2 Rock layers younger than 250 million years have been eroded away and no longer exist in the immediate vicinity of the Grand Canyon. 3 The Rocky Mountains begin to form 60-70 million years ago and at some point later the Colorado River is born.
