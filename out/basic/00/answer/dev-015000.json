Fructose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Sugar cane is a natural source of sucrose, or table sugar. Sucrose, glucose and fructose are important carbohydrates, commonly referred to as simple sugars. Sugar is found naturally in whole foods and is often added to processed foods to sweeten them and increase flavor. Simple carbohydrates are classified as either monosaccharides or disaccharides. Monosaccharides are the simplest, most basic units of carbohydrates and are made up of only one sugar unit. Glucose and fructose are monosaccharides and are the building blocks of sucrose, a disaccharide. Thus, disaccharides are just a pair of linked sugar molecules. They are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed -- a dehydration reaction Glucose molecules come in several structural forms, such as a straight or ring structure, but all glucose molecules have 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution.

Astrocytes may also limit the number of synapses since astrocyte membranes can ensheath the neuronal processes and thus compete with synapses. Astroglial cells can also be involved in the elimination of synapses in the CNS, the process which underlies the final tuning and plasticity of the neuronal inputs. Astrocytes (literally \u2018star-like cells\u2019) are the most numerous and diverse neuroglial cells in the CNS. While most neuroscientists think they know what an astrocyte is, there is no uniform and unequivocal definition of an astrocyte. Not all astrocytes are star-like cells, not all of them express the specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), not all contact brain capillaries. Astrocytes are actually the cell population in the brain which are left over after one would remove neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells.

If a dog is left in a parked car on a hot summer day, or has been out playing or running for a long time in the heat, he can easily get heat stroke.

REDUCTION OF SALT USAGE Waste brine typically can contaminate the general groundwater in your neighborhood and possibly that of your own well. Consequently, reducing salt usage while maintaining water system treatment effectiveness is important. An injection well is a device that places fluid deep underground into porous rock formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow soil layer. The fluid may be water, wastewater, brine (salt water), or water mixed with chemicals. The EPA' Underground Injection Control defines an injection well as a bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or a dug hole that is deeper than it is wide, or an improved sinkhole, or a subsurface fluid distribution system.", "19398": "Finn was a human male who served as a stormtrooper in the First Order approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor.

Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Opposite of a convergent boundary, a divergent boundary is formed by the spreading of a tectonic plate. This process feeds magma to the surface, creating new crust. Divergent zones in oceanic plates form a geological feature called a ridge, forced upward by the pressure of the rising magma. The third type of plate boundary occurs where tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary. As the plates rub against each other, huge stresses are set up that can cause portions of the rock to break, resulting in earthquakes. In the theory of plate tectonics, the earth's crust is broken into plates that move around relative to each other. As a result of this movement, three types of plate boundaries are formed: divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries. Plates move away from one another at divergent boundaries. This happens at mid-ocean ridges. Plates move towards one another at convergent boundaries; one plate is forced below another in a process called subduction. Earthquakes and composite volcanoes are common at this type of boundary. Some features, such as earthquakes and volca-noes, are more common at tectonic plate boundaries than at other places on Earth. Other features, such as mid-ocean ridges and ocean trenches, form only at plate boundaries.

Some hernia repairs are performed using a small telescope known as a laparoscope. If your surgeon has recommended a hernia repair, this brochure can help you understand what a hernia is and what your treatment options are. Surgery has generally been recommended for all inguinal hernias to avoid complications such as strangulation, in which a loop of intestine becomes tightly trapped in a hernia, cutting off the blood supply to that part of the intestine. An inguinal hernia occurs when part of the small intestine protrudes through a tear or weakness in your groin (the area between your abdomen and your thigh). Anybody can get an inguinal hernia, but it is more common among males. Symptoms of inguinal hernia include a bulge in the groin area and pain, pressure, or aching at the bulge\u2014especially when lifting, bending, or coughing. These symptoms usually subside during rest periods. Men may also have swelling around the testicles.

When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. This process is called the retrogradation of starch. This example shows the measurement of bread. Tweet. When starch is heated with water for gelatinization and then let stand, the association and rearrangement of amylopectin in swelled starch particles proceed to gradually harden the particles. Bread that was initially soft and moist becomes progressively harder and dry. Starch retrogradation can be temporarily reversed by reheating loaves of bread in the oven or individual slices in the toaster. Reheating brings the bread back up to the gelatinization temperature and causes the molecules to reabsorb some moisture. However, there is a way that this process can be reversed-at least temporarily... During baking, starch molecules in the raw bread dough begin to gelatinize at about 150\u00b0, meaning they absorb moisture, swell, and then become semi-firm. Chemical modification of starches can reduce or enhance the retrogradation. Waxy, high amylopectin, starches have also much lesser tendency to retrogradate.

An upper respiratory tract infection effects the nose, throat. larynx, and trachea, while a lower infection effects the lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and aveoli. Diphtheria, influenza, and the common cold are all upper respiratory infections, so the answer is TB and pneumonia.
