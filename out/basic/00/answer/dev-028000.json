Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation which, like visible light or infrared, make up a portion of the entire spectrum.

PROTHROMBIN GENE MUTATION Prothrombin gene mutation is the second most common cause of inherited thrombophilia in the United States. It is present in about 2% of Caucasians. It is caused by a cha nge or mutation in the gene for the blood clotting protein called prothrombin (which is also called Factor II). People with the prothrombin gene mutation have higher than normal levels of prothrombin in their blood, making them prone to blood clots, most common in the veins. People who have prothrombin mutation G20210A have a 2-to-3 fold increase in the risk of DVT. Persons who have this mutation plus the Factor V Leiden mutation have a 10-to-20 fold increase in thrombotic risk. Prothrombin mutations have also been linked with thrombotic events other than DVT, including recurrent miscarriage (repeat spontaneous abortions). It raises the risk of thrombosis significantly for both males and females in all age groups. Prothrombin mutation G20210A gives rise to slowed mRNA degradation and to an increase in circulating prothrombin levels.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution. For the future, many think a better way of making biofuels will be from grasses and saplings, which contain more cellulose. Cellulose is the tough material that makes up plants' cell walls, and most of the weight of a plant is Why Biodiesel is Good. 1.

The other type is in vitro which is using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to create copies of fragments of DNA. Conjugation and Plasmids In a process called conjugation, genetic material is transferred between two bacterial cells (of same or different species) that are temporarily joined. The DNA transfer is one way: One cell donates the DNA,a nd the other receives ti. The donor uses sex pili to attach to the recipient. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells. In transduction, bacteriophage carry bacterial genes from one hose cell to another; transduction is a type of horizontal gene transfer. Answer Organisms all possess DNA as their genetic material. What differentiates them (and their DNA) is the sequence of base-pairs within the DNA.

Common units for volume are cubic centimeters (cm 3), cubic meters (m 3), cubic inches (in 3), and cubic feet (ft 3). Density is a characteristic property of a substance. The density of a substance is the relationship between the mass of the substance and how much space it takes up (volume). Density equals the mass of the substance divided by its volume; D = m/v.

Christians were first, and horribly, targeted for persecution as a group by the emperor Nero in 64 AD. A colossal fire broke out at Rome, and destroyed much of the city. The article that follows explores the history of persecution of the early church, some of the reasons behind it, and two important Christian responses to persecution: the glorification of martyrdom and the writings of the apologists. Rick Wade provides a succinct summary of the persecution suffered by the early church in the first three centuries and how the church grew stronger as a result of this attention. He suggests that we should be prepared to face similar trials as our culture becomes less tolerant of true Christian faith. The persecution of the early Church may be viewed as two distinct periods. The first period being from Nero in 64 to the end of the reign of Maximinus in 238. The second period extending from the Decian persecution of 249 through to the signing of the 'Edict of Milan' in 313. {5} It has been calculated that between the first persecution under Nero in 64 to the Edict of Milan in 313, Christians experienced 129 years of persecution and 120 years of toleration and peace. Christian Persecution: Many of the Early Disciples Died for their Faith. Christian persecution was a dramatic part of early church history. For anyone who holds that the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ was a man-made hoax conspired by a group of disciples should check out the legacy of martyrdom. Reasons for Persecution. There are several important and interrelated reasons for the persecution of the early church. First was the problem of identity. Christianity was identified at first with Judaism, but people quickly came to see it as a different religion. The persecution of the early Christians started with Jesus Himself when He was crucified.

Marx thought that the economic system of communism would replace capitalism. Communism is based on principles meant to correct the problems caused by capitalism. The most important principle of communism is that no private ownership of property should be allowed. Though the term communism can refer to specific political parties, at its core, communism is an ideology of economic equality through the elimination of private property.

The most common is osteoarthritis, a condition in which the cartilage, the protective cushioning between the joints, wears out. When this happens, the bones rub directly against other bones. This causes structural changes that can be seen on X-rays. The joints most often affected are the hands and the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities (knees, hips, feet). In osteoarthritis, there is a steady worsening and decline of joint cartilage. There are over 100 different forms of arthritis. The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), a result of trauma to the joint, infection of the joint, or age. Other arthritis forms are rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and related autoimmune diseases. The pain from arthritis is due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damage to the joint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle strains caused by forceful movements against stiff painful joints and fatigue.

However, chromosomally abnormal polar bodies are not guaranteed to induce the development of an abnormal zygote. These 10 animal facts will amaze you. A polar body, sometimes referred to as a polar cell, is a cell found within the ovum of mammals as well as plants. It is the byproduct of the natural process of cell division during oogenesis and meiosis. When the ovum is fertilized by the plant's male gamete, the polar bodies also are fertilized by a second male cell. They then develop not into a plant but into endosperm, a cell structure that functions to produce nutrients for the growing plant cell. polar body. noun. : a cell that separates from an oocyte during meiosis: a: one containing a nucleus produced in the first meiotic division\u2014called also first polar body b: one containing a nucleus produced in the second meiotic division\u2014called also second polar body.

An understanding of geomorphology and its processes is therefore essential to the understanding of physical geography.
