This article is about H1N1 and how it was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009 and also how the virus got its nickname, \u201cswine flu\u201d. H1N1 got the nickname because tested showed that many of the genes in H1N1 was similar to the genes in viruses normally found in pigs. Different types of viruses and diseases caused by them: Polio. It is a viral infection, which is caused by a polio-virus that attacks and infects the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord, which results in severe injuries and paralysis.

PROTHROMBIN GENE MUTATION Prothrombin gene mutation is the second most common cause of inherited thrombophilia in the United States. It is present in about 2% of Caucasians. It is caused by a cha nge or mutation in the gene for the blood clotting protein called prothrombin (which is also called Factor II). People with the prothrombin gene mutation have higher than normal levels of prothrombin in their blood, making them prone to blood clots, most common in the veins. People who have prothrombin mutation G20210A have a 2-to-3 fold increase in the risk of DVT. Persons who have this mutation plus the Factor V Leiden mutation have a 10-to-20 fold increase in thrombotic risk. Prothrombin mutations have also been linked with thrombotic events other than DVT, including recurrent miscarriage (repeat spontaneous abortions). It raises the risk of thrombosis significantly for both males and females in all age groups.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution. For the future, many think a better way of making biofuels will be from grasses and saplings, which contain more cellulose.

Once the seedling starts to photosynthesize, it is no longer dependent on the seed's energy reserves. The apical meristems start growing and give rise to the root and shoot. The first true leaves expand and can often be distinguished from the round cotyledons through their species-dependent distinct shapes. Germination is the process by which a plant grows from a seed. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm. In addition, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the growth of hyphae from fungal spores, is also germination.

Heat stroke is perhaps one of the most common causes of heavy dog panting that can lead to devastating damage to the dog's physical health. If a dog is left in a parked car on a hot summer day, or has been out playing or running for a long time in the heat, he can easily get heat stroke. Several other signs accompany excessive panting in dogs, such as cough, discomfort, heart problems, anemia, heat strokes, fainting etc. A panting puppy might be of concern, when it is a perfectly normal response to heat or exercise. A puppy is considered to be panting when the breathing rate is 10x the normal rate. The following are some of the possible causes of abnormal and excessive panting in dogs, which may be a real threat to dog health, not to mention that some of them if not attended to immediately can turn fatal. Dogs tend to pant a great deal. Because they don't sweat the way humans do, panting is their way of cooling down when they are overheated, in a particularly warm climate, after exerting themselves. This is not, however, the only reason why dogs pant. Panting is also an important way for dogs to oxygenate their blood. Medication.

The article that follows explores the history of persecution of the early church, some of the reasons behind it, and two important Christian responses to persecution: the glorification of martyrdom and the writings of the apologists. Rick Wade provides a succinct summary of the persecution suffered by the early church in the first three centuries and how the church grew stronger as a result of this attention. He suggests that we should be prepared to face similar trials as our culture becomes less tolerant of true Christian faith. The persecution of the early Church may be viewed as two distinct periods. The first period being from Nero in 64 to the end of the reign of Maximinus in 238. The second period extending from the Decian persecution of 249 through to the signing of the 'Edict of Milan' in 313. {5} It has been calculated that between the first persecution under Nero in 64 to the Edict of Milan in 313, Christians experienced 129 years of persecution and 120 years of toleration and peace.

Calcium supplements offer a good source of calcium and help protect bones and teeth. Most commonly, calcium is present in supplements mainly in the form of carbonates and citrates. It is also present in supplements or certain fortified foods in the form of phosphates, gluconates, and lactates, to some extent. However, other excellent sources of calcium exist. Sources of well-absorbed calcium for vegans include calcium-fortified soy milk and juice, calcium-set tofu, soybeans and soynuts, bok choy, broccoli, collards, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard greens, and okra.", "10958": "Mastocytosis is a disorder that can occur in both children and adults.

Hail is precipitation in the form of large balls or lumps of ice. There was a storm that produced hail early last week.

As the hailstone moves up and down through a storm, it collides with water droplets, growing larger with each collision. Hailstones can be as large as oranges and grapefruits. Hail is a form of solid precipitation. It is distinct from sleet, though the two are often confused for one another. It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is called a hailstone. Sleet falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited at cold temperatures. Hail is formed in huge cumulonimbus clouds, commonly known as thunderheads. When the ground is heated during the day by the sun, the air close to the ground is heated as well. Hot air, being less dense and therefore lighter than cold air, rises and cools. As it cools, its capacity for holding moisture decreases.

The incubation period of a cold ranges between 2-4 days, depending upon the severity of the viral attack. In some cases, it can be as short as 10 hours of infection and as long as 5-7 days. Read the article to know the details. The incubation period for a common cold depends on the kind of virus it's caused by. The incubation period is at least two days and up to a week or two weeks depending on the cause. Three weeks is too long as an incubation period for a common cold. The incubation period is usually a few days in most people, but it can be up to a week. If you had said two weeks, then I would have said maybe, but I doubt that you picked up the cold from your friend. From the time a cold virus enters the nose, it takes 8-12 hours for the viral reproductive cycle to be completed and for new cold virus to be released in nasal secretions. (13) This interval is called the incubation period. Cold symptoms can also begin shortly after virus is first produced in the nose (10-12 hours). (13) The time from the beginning of the infection to the peak of symptoms is typically 36-72 hours. The symptoms of a common cold include sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, and mild general symptoms like headache, feverishness, chilliness, and not feeling well in general.

The researchers say that possessing the variant is associated with a person having a shorter average telomere length that equates to about 3.6 years of age-related telomere shortening. The telomeres found at the ends of chromosomes shorten with age. Genetic tests to determine how quickly a person will age may soon be available, according to several newspapers. The news is based on the recent discovery of a genetic variation that apparently predisposes some people to faster ageing. Baird et al. (48) described single-telomere length analysis as a viable platform for measuring telomere length in 2003. Single-telomere-length analysis was developed to measure the telomere length of single chromosomes to investigate whether individual critically short telomeres influenced cell senescence. Consequently, yeast cells are more amenable to studies of telomere structure and dynamics. Telomeres in inbred mice are much longer (20,000\u2013150,000 base pairs) than telomeres in humans, and mice have a higher baseline expression of telomerase (1, 10).

In the dynamic routing algorithm, the algorithm and the protocol is responsible for routing the packets and making the changes accordingly in the routing table. Nowadays, the static routing is seldom used. With the technological advancements, the dynamic routing is used to route the packets in the network, efficiently.

In most networks, a singledynamic routing protocol is used; however, there are cases where different parts of the net-work can use different routing protocols.Since the early 1980s, several different dynamic routing protocols have emerged. Dynamic routing protocols not only perform these path determination and route table update functions but also determine the next-best path if the best path to a destination becomes unusable. The capability to compensate for topology changes is the most important advantage dynamic routing offers over static routing. Convergence.

To date, what is clear is that both evolutionary patterns \u2013 phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium have played at least some role in the evolution of life.

Note that strong acids and bases are rarely a concern in biochemistry (as they are in general chemistry). Strong acids ionize (break into ions) completely when dissolved in water. In other words, a strong acid is a good proton donor. For example, the strong acid HCl gives up all its protons to water: Weak bases exist in chemical equilibrium much in the same way as weak acids do, with a base dissociation constant (Kb) indicating the strength of the base. For example, when ammonia is put in water, the following equilibrium is set up: Bases that have a large K b will ionize more completely and are thus stronger bases. In chemistry, a weak base is a chemical base that does not ionize fully in an aqueous solution. As Broensted\u2013Br\u00f8nsted lowry bases are proton, acceptors a weak base may also be defined as a chemical base in which protonation is. Incomplete this results in a relatively pH ph compared to strong. bases The acid illustrated is hydrochloric acid. Pure hydrochloric acid is a gas, but it dissolves easily in water to produce a solution of hydrogen ion and chloride ion. Since nearly all of it is dissociated in water, it is called a strong acid. Acids that do not dissociate completely are called weak acids.", "15411": "There pills are white,yellow,pink,green, and some others.If they are brand name they are always small and circular.
