It lies between the dorsal nerve tube and the gut. It increases locomotory power and internal support. Best Answer: Notochord is the skeletal rod which lies lengthwise between the central nervous system and the alimentary canal or the gut and the chordates possess it at young stage of development. In adult vertebrates, it is replaced by vertebral column. On the other hand a nerve cord is a solid strand of nervous tissue, forming part of central nervous system, especially of invertebrates.

If a person has two copies (homozygous) of MTHFR C677T, or has one copy of C677T and one of A1298C, then it is likely that elevated homocysteine levels are due to these inherited mutations, or that the mutations are contributing to them.

Conjugation and Plasmids In a process called conjugation, genetic material is transferred between two bacterial cells (of same or different species) that are temporarily joined.

This type of well seems to defy gravity because the pressure that builds up between layers of rock gets relieved when the water finds a path to the open air. An aquifer provides the water source for an artesian well. This is the layer of permeable rock, such as limestone or sandstone, that absorbs water from an inlet path at high elevation, such as the top of a mountain. The water source might be fed by snowmelt or precipitation. Ad. An aquifer is a geologic layer of permeable and porous rock such as sandstone or limestone and that provides the water source for the artesian well. The aquifer absorbs and stores water and in an artesian well the porous stone is sandwiched between a top and bottom layer of impermeable rock such as shale or clay. This causes positive pressure. My mom drinks artesian well water. An artesian or flowing well in Georgia. Pressure on the aquifer pushes water up the well without the need for a pump. Credit: USGS. Chemically and physically, artesian groundwater is not different than other groundwater, but it comes to the surface differently. Your mom is drinking water from a well that taps an aquifer that is confined. So, the water in this aquifer is squeezed by the other rocks, creating pressure in the water-bearing aquifer. When an artesian aquifer is tapped by a well the pressure pushes the water up the well, sometimes all the way to the surface, creating a flowing well.

A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) (for someone over 70 normal temp is 96.8\u00b0F (36\u00b0C)).

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. The DHCP server maintains a pool of IP addresses and leases an address to any DHCP-enabled client when it starts up on the network.

(For an overview of this area of law, check out Defamation Law Made Simple .). defamation. Defamation is a statement that injures a third party's reputation. The tort of defamation includes both libel (written statements) and slander (spoken statements). The distinction between slander and libel comes in the form of the publication. Slander involves the oral publication of a defamatory remark that is heard by another, which injures the subject's reputation or character. Slander can occur through the use of a hand gesture or verbal communication that is not recorded. Libel, on the other hand, is the written publication of a defamatory remark that has the tendency to injure another's reputation or character. The primary difference between slander and libel is that libel is the written or otherwise printed public defamation of a person or entity, while slander is the spoken defamation of a person or entity. Slander can also include bodily gestures while libel can include published photographs. Slander involves verbally maligning the reputation or activities of another individual or entity, using information that is known to be false or misleading. Libel occurs when a person makes a false, written statement intended to harm another person. L Libel and slander are both forms of defamation.

Split and merge into it. Answer by JEK. Confidence votes 13.1K. The filtrate is the liquid that is left after you filter something -- the liquid that is now missing the solid that was filtered out. For instance, if you are making drip coffee, it is the coffee beverage (the coffee grinds are called the filtrand ). Answer A filtration residue is the solid substance left in the filter media(filter paper, sponge, activated charcoal, etc.)... Whenever filtration occurs when th \u2026 e solid substance is separated from the liquid the recovered liquid is called filtrate while the recovered solid is called residue or precipitate. This is a more common method of separating an insoluble solid from a liquid. An example. of such a mixture is sand and water. Filtration is used in water treatment plants, where. water from the river is filtered to remove solid particles. Here is a basic lab setup for filtration: This process involves the use of a filter paper placed in a filter funnel.
