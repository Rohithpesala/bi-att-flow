Homeostasis can be defined as a property of an organism or system that helps it maintain its parameters within a normal range of values. It is key to life, and failures in homeostasis can lead to diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Homeostasis in a general sense refers to stability, balance or equilibrium. It is the body's attempt to maintain a constant internal environment. Maintaining a stable internal environment requires constant monitoring and adjustments as conditions change. When homeostasis is interrupted in your cells, there are pathways to correct or worsen the problem. In addition to the internal control mechanisms, there are external influences based primarily on lifestyle choices and environmental exposures that influence our body's ability to maintain cellular health. Maintaining homeostasis in the body is vital for all body functioning, metabolism, neuronal functioning, organ function, etc. Cells make up tissues, and tissues make organs, o \u2026 rgans make up the organ systems, and organ systems make the organism. Homeostasis is the process of keeping a balance of solutes and solvent within a cell. The environment of the cell interior is kept at a state despite changes in the conditions \u2026 of the external environment. Answered. In Biology. Homeostasis or homoeostasis (homeo- + -stasis) is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant. Examples of homeostasis include the regulation of temperature and the balance between acidity and alkalinity (pH). It is a process that maintains the stability of the human body's internal environment in response to changes in external conditions.", "16669": "foam made by adding water to polyurethane plastics.", "16671": "or button onions, pearl", "16672": "$1,000 to $1,500 for a full treatment", "16673": "number of nucleons = protons + neutrons. 2 Z (atomic number): number of protons.", "16674": "Releaser pheromones, Primer pheromones, Signaller pheromones and Modulator pheromones.", "16675": "$147", "16676": "1 Indigestion. 2 Constipation. 3 Stomach virus. 4 Menstrual cramps. 5 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Pain in the lower left side of the abdomen is called left lower quadrant pain. It is often related to the digestive tract, but can also be related to conditions of the body wall, skin, blood vessels, urinary tract, or reproductive organs. Pain in the lower abdomen is often related to the digestive tract, but can also be related to conditions of the body wall, skin, blood vessels, urinary tract, or reproductive organs. The area may be tender to the touch or the pain may be severe and the whole abdomen might be rigid. Severe pain that comes in waves may be caused by kidney stones. Trauma to the body wall, hernias, and shingles can also cause lower abdominal pain. A hernia is a weakening of muscle or tissue that allows organs or other tissues to protrude through it. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas. Abdominal pain can range in intensity from a mild stomach ache to severe acute pain. The pain is often nonspecific and can be caused by a variety of conditions. Diverticulitis typically causes pain in the left lower abdomen where most colonic diverticula are located. Pain from the gallbladder (biliary colic or cholecystitis) typically is felt in the middle, upper abdomen, or the right upper abdomen near where the gallbladder is located. Urine Tract Infection. Urine tract infection could be a cause of lower right side abdominal pain. This could be due to an infection affecting the right kidney, ureter or bladder. Though this condition more often causes a central lower abdominal pain, it could also lead to pain in lower right side of the abdomen. Other symptoms of urinary tract infection could include: 1 Feeling feverish. 2 Reduced appetite. 3 Increased frequency of passing urine. 4 Pain or stinging sensation on passing urine.", "16677": "A deemed contract is normally in place when any type of customer moves into new premises and starts to consume gas, electricity, or both, without agreeing a contract with a supplier.", "16678": "Unstable angina is a condition in which your heart doesn't get enough blood flow and oxygen.", "16680": "The melting temperature for the sequence TGCTCA is, 2(1+2) + 4(1+2) = 18\u00b0C.", "16682": "The mutations that cause thalassemia disrupt the normal production of hemoglobin and cause low hemoglobin levels and a high rate of red blood cell destruction, causing anemia.", "16683": "The flag of Laos was adopted on December 2, 1975.

As we have a reference to the filter available in the controller, we can invoke the filter directly from here. How to Use a Filter in a Controller in AngularJS. In this post, I am sharing how to use a filter in a controller in AngularJS. Very easy way of injecting a filter is to inject dependency with the name composed of the filter name and the Filter suffix: . E.g. the dependency customFilter injects custom filter. The injected component is a filter function. Note that you can use this approache to inject filter also to services and directives. Following example injects filter called custom. Another way is to inject $filter dependency to your controller and fetch required filter inside the controller. The filter functionality of AngularJS is often used inside the view when you need to filter a set of items in a collection. I had overlooked the usefulness this might have as a tool inside the controller as well. It can be very useful in \u201cquerying\u201d information. Same with a search box that is filtering a local data source. This post just highlights the fact that you can use the filter in the controller as well if there is a situation where you want to find an object or objects in a collection using controller code. It is common to see filter used in view but apparently I found that in some conditions we need to use filter in controller. You have to know that in order to inject a filter, you need to use format yourFilterNameFilter. 2) Custom Filter. We also can use our own filter to be called inside controller. It is almost same like above by injecting the filter name yourFilterNameFilter but I want to show you the alternative way with built-in $filter. Let\u2019s we create simple filter named hello.

Making the world better, one answer at a time. 1) The notochord is the defining structure of the phylum Chordata, which includes all vertebrates. In its mature state, the notochord is a rod of large cells constrained by a thick extracellular sheath and positioned between the developing spinal cord and gut. No, the notochord and the nerve cord arise from different germ layers. The notochord is replaced by an ossified backbone, though there are still remnants between the vertebrae \u2026 . The nerve cord, however, is protected by the ossified vertebral column. In the vertebrates it becomes part of the backbone.

For a typical 2,500 square-foot, two-story home and lot (sale price of $180,000), the additional cost amounts to about $7,000. The additional first cost of ICF construction should be weighed against longer-term benefits.

One of the reasons for its popularity is that it is one of the very few agents (perhaps even the only one) shown to produce some skin tightening and modestly reduce facial sag. The researchers found that adding DMAE to the cultures of fibroblasts (key type of skin cells) produced the effect known as vacuolization. Vacuolization is often observed in cells after various types of damage as cells try to encapsulate and excrete foreign agents and/or their own damaged components. Other industrial products that contain DMAE include polyurethane lacquers and foams, water-based paint and surface coating, and corrosion inhibitor formulas. In pharmaceuticals, DMAE is used to treat central nervous system and brain conditions. Proponents claim that DMAE increases the brain\u2019s production of acetylcholine, which affects functions such as short-term memory, learning, REM sleep and attention. It is sold in health-food stores as a supplement that enhances brain function and mood. DMAE has several industrial and commercial applications.

Portland cement, the basic ingredient of concrete, is a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and small amounts of other ingredients to which gypsum is added in the final grinding process to regulate the setting time of the concrete. A cement is a binder, a substance that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The word cement can be traced back to the Roman term opus caementicium, used to describe masonry resembling modern concrete that was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder. The most important uses of cement are as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material.

The second time around the doe can have twins-triplets and in rare occasions quintuplets. The pregnancy, or gestation, period takes 6 1/2 to 7 months. Fawns are born from mid-March through June. Twins are the norm for older does, while young does usually give birth to a single fawn. Deer less than a year old, called fawns, are characterized by white spots over a reddish-brown coat. If a doe is not mated, a second estrus occurs approximately 28 days later. Mating occurs from October to December and gestation is approximately 6 and a half months (200 days) . In her first year of breeding, a female generally has one fawn, but 2 per litter (occasionally 3 or 4) are born in subsequent years.

Solar pool heating system prices for a residential pool can vary based on the location and size of the pool, location of the solar panels, desired temperature and season, and type of pool equipment. Because of all the variables, it is impossible to give an accurate estimate without careful inspection of the site. Once a solar pool heater is installed, your heat is FREE from the sun. With a gas heater you need to pay the gas company depending on how much you use the heater. In the spring and fall when you really need heat, you use the pool heater more, so it costs you more-but solar energy is still free. The general rule of thumb is 80% surface area of the pool. Solar pool heating system prices for a residential pool can range anywhere from $2,500 to $7,000. The location and size of the pool, location of the solar collectors, desired temperature and season, and type of pool equipment determine system size and costs. A solar pool heating system uses your pool\u2019s existing filter pump to circulate water through the system. A diverted valve diverts the water so that it flows through the many small passages of the solar collector where it is warmed by the sun. If you are currently using a gas or electric pool heater, the savings from solar pool heating system will pay for itself in 2-3 years of installation. For example, the average system costs about $5,500 and it typically costs about $2,000 a year to heat a pool with gas. A solar pool heater can be installed for $3,500 to $8,000.

Microscopic colitis refers to two related medical conditions which cause diarrhea: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. Both conditions are characterized by the presence of chronic watery diarrhea, normal appearances on colonoscopy and characteristic histopathology findings of inflammatory cells. People who develop microscopic colitis are characteristically, though not exclusively, middle-aged females. The average age of diagnosis is 65 but 25% of cases are diagnosed below the age of 45. Patients have a long history of watery diarrhoea, which may be profuse. Microscopic colitis refers to inflammation of the colon that is only visible when the colon's lining is examined under a microscope. The appearance of the inner colon lining in microscopic colitis is normal by visual inspection during colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made when a doctor, while performing colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, takes biopsies (small samples of tissue) of the normal-appearing lining, and then examines the biopsies Microscopic colitis takes two forms: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis.

Colitis means inflammation of the colon. The colon, also known as the large intestine or large bowel, constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. The colon is a long, muscular tube that receives digested food from the small intestine. It removes water from the undigested food, stores the undigested food, and then eliminates it from the body through bowel movements. The rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus.

There are currently 61 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 99 nuclear reactors in 30 states in the United States. Thirty-five of these plants have two or more reactors. The Palo Verde plant in Arizona has 3 reactors and had the largest combined net summer generating capacity of 3,937 megawatts (MW) in 2012. Davis-Besse. Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Ohio\u2019s first nuclear power plant, is located 35 miles east of Toledo. The single reactor plant produced its first electricity in 1977. The nuclear reactor is contained inside the spherical containment building in the center-left and right are cooling towers which are common cooling devices used in all thermal power stations, and likewise, emit water vapor from the non-radioactive steam turbine section of the power plant. The nuclear reactor is the heart of the plant. In its central part, the reactor core's heat is generated by controlled nuclear fission. With this heat, a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor. On June 26, 1954, at Obninsk, Russia, the nuclear power plant APS-1 with a net electrical output of 5 MW was connected to the power grid, the world's first nuclear power plant that generated electricity for commercial use. As of June 01, 2015 in 31 countries 438 nuclear power plant units with an installed electric net capacity of about 379 GW are in operation and 67 plants with an installed capacity of 65 GW are in 16 countries under construction. On June 27, 1954, the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid started operations at the Soviet city of Obninsk. The world's first full scale power station, Calder Hall in England opened on October 17, 1956. The nuclear reactor is the heart of the plant. In its central part, the reactor core's heat is generated by controlled nuclear fission.

Even though seeds are more advanced than spores in more ways than one, both of them are necessary for the propagation of plant life and are effective ways by which plant species survive in the present world. Summary: 1. In terms of size, seeds are larger than spores. The sporophyte produces spores which are dispersed and, when conditions are right, they'll germinate and grow into gametophytes. Spores (and thus, gametophytes) are usually haploid, like sperm in men and eggs in women.", "18088": "A shower pump is an electric pump that is used to maintain a steady flow and pressure of water in a shower. The pump works best on stored water as compared to water that comes directly from the mains. With a shower pump, the fear of water suddenly stopping when you are taking a shower is eliminated. Power showers can work in three different ways. Either the pump can be built in with the mixer unit of the shower and is fitted to the shower wall, a pump is installed between the mixer and the shower head or the pump is fitted between the water tank and the mixer. The final option is by far the most versatile and can be used with a number of different shower types.

Eczema is a common skin condition with multiple clinical patterns, characterised histologically by a spongiotic tissue reaction pattern. The terms eczema and dermatitis are often used interchangeably to denote a polymorphic inflammatory reaction pattern involving the epidermis and dermis. Once you have been diagnosed with the condition, spongiotic dermatitis treatment will usually commence with the application of topical skin creams and lotions prescribed by your doctor. Medications containing menthol as well as corticosteroid preparations are both used in spongiotic dermatitis treatment. A large part of initial spongiotic dermatitis treatment involves avoidance. Avoidance of known skin irritants be they chemicals in washing powders, elements in clothing or components of foods is all part of spongiotic dermatitis treatment if one subscribes to the view that prevention is better than cure. Spongiotic dermatitis is a confusing phrase that actually means something quite simple.

Sometimes knee pain is the only sign of a hip problem. Hip pain can be caused by a number of injuries or conditions. The most common cause of acute hip pain is inflamed tendons, often caused by over-exercising. This condition can be very painful, but usually heals within a few days. The most common cause of long-term hip pain is arthritis, or joint swelling. Arthritis can cause pain, stiff and tender joints, and difficulty walking. There are two main types of arthritis: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Pain in the hip can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the hip can all result in pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other joints in the body, such as the inflammation resulting from arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the hip. Trauma or injury, including bone fracture, is also a cause of hip pain. Hip pain may also occur because of a problem with the back or spine. Depending upon the cause of hip pain, the pain may occur when walking, running, or engaging in activity. Bursitis of one of the two bursae of the hip (sacs that provide cushioning between bones and tissues) can cause hip pain. Hip pain is a common complaint that can be caused by a wide variety of problems. The precise location of your hip pain can provide valuable clues about the underlying cause. Problems within the hip joint itself tend to result in pain on the inside of your hip or your groin. Hip pain on the outside of your hip, upper thigh or outer buttock is usually caused by problems with muscles, ligaments, tendons and other soft tissues that surround your hip joint. Hip pain can sometimes be caused by diseases and conditions in other areas of your body, such as your lower back or your knees. This type of pain is called referred pain. Most hip pain can be controlled with self-care at home. 1 Causes In the hip joint, the head of the femur (thighbone) swivels within the acetabulum, the socket, made up of pelvic bones. While many causes of hip pain can arise from the joint itself, there are numerous structures surrounding the hip that can also be the source of pain. Trauma is often the cause of hip pain, but any source of inflammation may cause pain in the hip area. Pain is one of the symptoms of inflammation, along with swelling, warmth, and redness; together these are signals and symptoms that a problem may exist. Sometimes pain from other areas of the body, such as the back or groin (from a hernia), can radiate to the hip. You might notice that your pain gets worse with activity, especially if it's caused by arthritis. Muscles and tendons in the hip can get overused. The hip bone itself can be fractured during a fall or other injury. Any of these conditions can lead to hip pain. If your hips are sore, here is a rundown of what might be causing your discomfort and how to get hip pain relief. The first step in getting the right treatment for your hip or knee problem is simple-a good diagnosis from a joint expert. Knee or hip pain can be caused by a number of conditions, some temporary, others chronic but treatable. A good diagnosis is the key to beginning an effective treatment plan. Some common causes of knee and hip pain include: Bursitis: This is the inflammation of bursa (fluid-filled space keepers) that are located near bony prominences.

Converting atmospheric pressure (atm) to kilopascal (kpa) is relatively simple after applying the standard conversion factors. But before that, let us first get an overview on these units of measure. Pressure is defined in science as the amount of force applied to an area. One standard atmosphere or atm is equal to 101,325 pascals or 101.325 kPa or 1,013.35 hPa. In most circumstances, this unit is closely associated with the hydrostatic pressure of the air above the point where the measurement was taken. To: 1 kilopascal [kPa] = 0.296133971 inch mercury (60\u00b0F) [inHg]. A kilopascal (kPa) is a decimal multiple of the pascal, which is the SI derived unit of pressure, stress, Young\u2019s modulus and ultimate tensile strength. It is a measure of force per unit area, defined as one newton per square meter. 1 kilopascal (kPa) is equal 7.5006168270417 torr (Torr). Pressure Unit Definition: Pressure-the amount of force that is applied to an area where the force is distributed.

The highest pulse rate for any individual is 220 bpm minus your age. A healthy person should achieve a pulse rate of 60 to 80 percent of this value during or after exercising. Hence for a person who is 50 years old, the desired pulse rate is calculated as follows 220-50=170 bpm. A pulse rate or heart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats in a minute which is also referred to as beats per minute (bpm). The pulse rate can be used to determine serious health issues, hence it is often the first point of check during a physical examination or emergency cases. Your resting heart rate should be between 60-100 beats per minute. If you are an athlete or train a lot, your resting heart rate could be lower. That is an average. Resting heart rate above 150 is tachycardia (fast). During exercise, you should shoot for between 40-60% of your heart rate max which is generally estimated by subtracting your age from 220. Example a 20 year old (220-20=200) would have a max heart rate of 200 The normal pulse rate for humans is usually 60 to 100 beats per minute, however, there are certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia which may alter the normal pulse rate of an individual.

By soaking nuts, grains, and seeds in water, salt water (brine), warm water or warm water mixed with a little of something acidic like yogurt, or lemon juice, we will have within 8 to 24 hours neutralised the enzyme inhibitors and anti nutrients as well as enhanced the beneficial nutrients for our use. When drying, do not dry nuts on a kitchen work top, they are susceptible to bacteria and mould while left hanging around wet, use a dehydrator or a very low oven. 5. I usually soak and dry at least 1 or 2 cups of nuts when I buy them, I then store in the fridge, I do use nuts a lot and like some to be ready for use. It is also recommended to rinse soaking seeds and nuts 2-3 times during the soak. After soaking, you can dehydrate at 105 degrees until the nuts/seeds are completely dry. Store in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them fresh. Use within 3 days. The following chart gives a good guideline for soaking and sprouting times of the most common seeds, nuts and grains. 1 Soak almonds for 8 to 12 hours. 2 Soak cashews for 2 to 3 hours. 3 Soak flax seeds for 6 hours. 4 Soak garbanzo beans for 12 to 48 hours. Drain, rinse and replenish the water in the bowl. Every 3 to 4 hours, the water in the bowl should be refreshed. The water in the bowl contains all the enzymes, acids and byproducts you are trying to remove from the nuts by soaking them. Note* You will have to soak the cashews for at least 1 hour. You can soak them for up to 24 hours. The longer you soak them the more creamy they will become. If you don\u2019t want to soak them for 24 hours, soaking them for an hour is totally sufficient. 1) Soak your raw cashews and vanilla bean in filtered water for at least 2 hours. 2) Discard soaking water and rinse your cashews and the vanilla bean. 3) Place soaked cashews, honey (or other sweetener), vanilla bean, a dash of sea salt and 4 cups of water in a blender.

Under this artificial or synthetic process, einsteinium may be produced at a rate of only one milligram for one whole year. In terms of texture, this element is soft. It also has a silvery color to it and contains similar properties to actinides. All isotopes of einsteinium are radioactive, decaying with half-lives ranging from a few seconds to about 1 year. Einsteinium is the heaviest element to be isolated in weigh-able form. The metal is chemically reactive, is quite and melts at 860\u00b0C (1580\u00b0F); one crystal structure is known. It is an element that is found in the debris from hydrogen bombs. But, there are very few actual uses for einsteinium besides scientific research. One isotope is used in the calibration process of the chemical analysis spectrometer in a lunar probe. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253 Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249 Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.

But, there are very few actual uses for einsteinium besides scientific research. One isotope is used in the calibration process of the chemical analysis spectrometer in a lunar probe. Not surprisingly, this production method is not the norm. Now, when einsteinium is required, plutonium is bombarded with neutrons in a reactor for several years until it is has taken on enough extra neutrons in the nucleus to pump it up to einsteinium. Elements and Periodic Table History. Einsteinium was discovered in the debris of the first thermonuclear explosion which took place on a Pacific atoll, on 1 November 1952. Fall-out material, gathered from a neighbouring atoll, was sent to Berkeley, California, for analysis. Einsteinium is a synthetic element with symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide. Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253. Einsteinium has a high rate of nuclear fission that results in a low critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254 Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 or even 2.26 kilograms, respectively, by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel or water reflector. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.

High level horizontal winds can prevent a hurricane from forming. The ocean plays a leading role in the Earth's climate. Hurricane Gustav was one of a series of hurricanes to strike the United States in 2008. Hurricanes originate over the tropical regions of the ocean under conditions where high humidity, light winds, and warm sea surface temperatures combine. The ocean plays an important role in shaping our climate and weather patterns. By analyzing the paths of almost 1,000 tropical cyclones, as well as data about the sea surface temperature and height before and after each storm, Ferrari and his students estimate that only about one-quarter of the warm water that is mixed downward by a hurricane remains in the ocean for more than a season. When a hurricane passes over an ocean, its powerful winds stir and mix the warm surface water with the colder, deeper water. This mixing results in warm water being forced down into the deep ocean and cold water being brought to the surface layer. This video segment adapted from NOVA scienceNOW highlights research that supports the idea that warmer oceans generate and sustain more intense hurricanes. Ongoing monitoring of sea surface temperature (SST) has supplied evidence that the world's oceans warmed 0.5\u00b0C between 1970 and 2005.

In general, the term is used to mean staring into something-often a shiny surface, but not always-for the purpose of divination. Visions that are seen are often interpreted intuitively by the person who is scrying. Water Scrying: A very popular method of scrying involves the use of water. While this can be a large body of water, such as a pond or lake, many people simply use a bowl. Nostradamus used a large bowl of water as a scrying tool, and put himself into a trance to interpret the visions he saw. Scrying Methods. Catoptromancy is a form of scrying and divination using a mirror. Also known as captromancy or enoptromancy. Mirror gazing is a popular method of scrying and comes in two forms. The first requires an individual to stand before a mirror and stare into their reflection. Native Americans used a form of scrying by way of rising smoke. This isn't just the stereotypical movie version where a blanket is draped over a small fire and then lifted to release the smoke. Rather watching the rising smoke from a flame and divining images held within the smoke stream. Scrying is something all witches learn from a very tender age, it means to perceive or to reveal. To scry you need a reflective surface to gaze into, this can be a crystal ball, a mirror, a candle flame or water. It is an ancient technique used for the purposes of divination. Scrying. Scrying is the practice of looking into a translucent ball or other material with the belief that things can be seen, such as spiritual visions, and less often for purposes of divination or fortune-telling. Although scrying is most commonly done with a crystal ball, it may also be performed using any smooth surface, such as a bowl of liquid, a pond, or a crystal. Like other aspects of divination and parapsychology, scrying is not supported by science as a method of predicting the future. One method of scrying using a crystal ball involves a self-induced trance. Initially, the medium serves as a focus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind in the same way as a mantra. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer begins a free association with the perceived images suggested. Scrying is one of the best known forms of divination, and can be done in a variety of ways. Basically, it's the practice of looking into some sort of reflective surface -- such as water, fire, glass, dark stones, etc. -- to see what messages, symbols, or visions may appear.

Most ozone (about 90%) resides in a layer that begins between 6 and 10 miles (10 and 17 kilometers) above the Earth's surface and extends up to about 30 miles (50 kilometers). This region of the atmosphere is called the stratosphere. The ozone layer is a concentration of ozone molecules in the stratosphere. About 90% of the planet's ozone is in the ozone layer. The layer of the Earth's atmosphere that surrounds us is called the troposphere. The stratosphere, the next higher layer, extends about 10\u201350 kilometers above the Earth's surface.

The only cancer for which the Pap test screens is cervical cancer. A cervical screening test (previously known as a smear test) is a method of detecting abnormal cells on the cervix. The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Detecting and removing abnormal cervical cells can prevent cervical cancer. In some areas, a test for HPV is the first test on the screening sample. In these cases, the sample is only checked for abnormal cells if HPV is found.

How often you should get a Pap test depends on your age. The first Pap test is recommended at age 21, regardless of sexual history or sexual activity. From ages 21 to 29, it's recommended that you have a Pap smear every three years. The Pap test helps identify women at risk for developing cervical cancer. Women 21-30 should get a Pap test every three years. Women over 30 should get a combined Pap test and HPV test every five years.

On the other hand, mtDNA is found in the mitochondria and, in most multicellular organisms, is inherited from the maternal lineage. Nuclear DNA is arranged in linearly organized chromosomes while mtDNA is organized as a circular chromosome The nuclear genome is inherited equally from both parents. See the Difference between mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA. Tags: biology, cytology, mitochondria, Mitochondrial DNA and Nuclear DNA, Mitochondrial DNA vs Nuclear DNA, nucleus, Polycistronic vs Monocistronic Monocistronic. Unlike mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA is found in every cell of the body. It consists of 46 chromosomes which are inherited from mother and father, both. The are comparatively longer with centromeres and telomers. DNA is composed of the adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine which are the main nucleotides. This chromosome is much shorter and codes for proteins that are used in metabolic purposes. Another main difference is that mitochondrial DNA is only transmitted from mother and never from the father while nuclear DNA is inherited from both, mother and father. Most other DNA present in eukaryotic organisms is found in the nucleus. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate evolutionary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the bacteria that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. In mammals, all mtDNA in a zygote is inherited solely from the mother, and this holds true for most other organisms as well. Difference Unlike nuclear DNA, whose genes are rearranged in the process of recombination, there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Best Answer: Nuclear DNA, nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (nDNA), is DNA contained within a nucleus of eukaryotic organisms. In most cases it encodes more of the genome than the mitochondrial DNA and is passed sexually rather than matrilineally. Nuclear DNA is the most common DNA used in forensic examinations. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the DNA located in organelles called mitochondria. In mammals, all mtDNA in a zygote is inherited solely from the mother, and this holds true for most other organisms as well. Difference Unlike nuclear DNA, whose genes are rearranged in the process of recombination, there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Main Difference: The main difference between nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA is, nuclear DNA is the standard 46 chromosome containing DNA in which you inherit 23 chromosome from one parent and the rest 23 from another one.

Cognitive behavioral therapy tries to identify and change negative thinking patterns and pushes for positive behavioral changes. DBT may be used to treat suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors. Practitioners in both -- psychiatrists and psychologists -- are mental health professionals. Their area of expertise is the mind -- and the way it affects behavior and well-being. They often work together to prevent, diagnose, and treat mental illness. An offering from the developer of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) was introduced to tackle psychological problems that could not be addressed by DBT. The Core Principle of Dialectical Behavior Therapy. The approach of DBT to psychological issues stemming from negative behavior is that people who spend their childhood in a bad environment due to biological factors react abnormally to emotions.

To date cognitive-behavioral therapy (specifically, Dialectical Behavior Therapy or DBT) is the only treatment that has been shown in controlled clinical trials to be effective treating BPD.Dialectical Behavior Therapy: Foundations. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive behavioral treatment that was originally developed to treat chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and it is now recognized as the gold standard psychological treatment for this population. 1 DBT individual therapy is focused on enhancing client motivation and helping clients to apply the skills to specific challenges and events in their lives. 2 In the standard DBT model, individual therapy takes place once a week for as long as the client is in therapy and runs concurrently with skills groups. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (or DBT) is a therapeutic approach that encompasses the principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy while placing an emphasis on validation and acceptance. Developed at the University of Washington by Dr. Marsha Linehan, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is. based upon four core principles: 1 The primacy of the therapeutic relationship. 2 A non-judgmental approach. 3 Differentiating between effective and ineffective behaviors. 4 Dialectical thinking. DBT is a modified form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that was developed in late 1970s by Marsha M. Linehan, a psychology researcher at the University of Washington, to treat people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and chronically suicidal individuals. DBT may be the first therapy that has been experimentally demonstrated to be generally effective in treating BPD. The first randomized clinical trial of DBT showed reduced rates of suicidal gestures, psychiatric hospitalizations, and treatment drop-outs when compared to treatment as usual.

A general rule to follow to determine the category of a morpheme is: 1 Content morphemes include free morphemes that are nouns, adverbs, adjective, and verbs. 2 Function morphemes can be free morphemes that are prepositions, pronouns, determiners, and conjunctions. Morpheme vs Phoneme. Difference between morpheme and phoneme is very important in linguistics. A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit of a language. A phoneme, on the other hand, is the smallest unit of speech. The significant difference between the two is that while a morpheme carries a meaning a phoneme does not. \u2022 Phonemes are the basic units of speech of a language that are used to create morphemes and words. \u2022 The main difference between a morpheme and phoneme is that while a morpheme carries a concrete meaning, a phoneme itself does not carry any meaning. Images Courtesy: 1 Words by Martin (CC BY-SA 2.0). It is also important to note two types of affixes: inflectional and derivational. Inflectional morphemes can only be a suffix, and they transform the function of a word, such as adding an '-ly' suffix to the base noun of 'friend.' This becomes the word 'friendly,' which has 2 morphemes. The-ly is an inflectional morpheme because it changes the noun into an adjective. Derivational morphemes can be either a suffix or a prefix, and they have the ability to transform either the function or the meaning of a word. An example would be adding the suffix '-less' to the noun 'meaning.' The suffix then makes the word the opposite of itself, thus drastically changing meaning. It actually has five syllables, though, which is a good example of why morphemes and syllables are not synonymous. Non-is an example of a prefix, or a morpheme that precedes a base morpheme. Perish is an example of a base morpheme, as it gives the word its essential meaning. -Able is an example of a suffix, or a morpheme that follows a base morpheme. Derivational morphemes can be either a suffix or a prefix, and they have the ability to transform either the function or the meaning of a word. An example would be adding the suffix '-less' to the noun 'meaning.' The suffix then makes the word the opposite of itself, thus drastically changing meaning.

When babies were born in ancient Sparta, Spartan soldiers would come by the house and check the baby. Spartan ascendancy did not last long. By the end of the 5th century BC, Sparta had suffered serious casualties in the Peloponnesian Wars, and its conservative and narrow mentality soon alienated many of its erstwhile allies. At the same time, its military class-the Spartiates-was in decline due to several factors. Spartan philosophers include Lycurgus and Chilon of Sparta. Although Athens has been praised as the inventor of democracy and philosophy, Sparta often has been viewed in popular culture as a society characterized by brutal, mindless discipline and merciless emphasis on physical fitness. As Athens grew in power under Pericles, Sparta felt more and more threatened and began to demand concessions from the Athenians. Pericles refused, and in 431 B.C. conflict between Athens and Sparta\u2019s ally Corinth pushed the Spartan king Archidamus II to invade Attica near Athens.

A few months later, Pericles himself succumbed. His death was, according to Thucydides, disastrous for Athens. Introduction. Spartan and Athenian society were very different in many aspects. However, at the same time, the two shared a myriad of characteristics in common. The differences are what set the two apart, while the things they shared in common are what united them as Greek city-states. Sparta and Athens shared similarities and differences in their systems of government, militaristic focuses, judgment and views of women.

Business sustainability is often defined as managing the triple bottom line-a process by which companies manage their financial, social and environmental risks, obligations and opportunities. These three impacts are sometimes referred to as profits, people and planet. A more robust definition is that business sustainability represents resiliency over time \u2013 businesses that can survive shocks because they are intimately connected to healthy economic, social and environmental systems. These businesses create economic value and contribute to healthy ecosystems and strong communities. In November 2009, under the direction of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) Secretary Ian Bowles, the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) commissioned a team to conduct a comprehensive six-month study of issues related to biomass sustainability and carbon policy (also referred to as the Manomet Study). Part of the Compliance glossary: Business sustainability, also known as corporate sustainability, is the management and coordination of environmental, social and financial demands and concerns to ensure responsible, ethical and ongoing success. The goal of sustainability requires a more extended timeline for return on investment (ROI) but once initial investments are made, they can actually lead to increased profitability. One example is free cooling for data centers, which takes advantage of naturally-occurring phenomena to control temperatures.

It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8\u201310%. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from \u22121 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear. The process of erosion had sloughed fragments of gold from the reef into the gully. - Robyn Annear. Ancient Greeks believed that gold was formed by the rays of the sun transforming common metals in the earth. Scientists today still think that gold formation is related to stars, specifically dying stars. At the core of a dying star-a supernova-elements begin to fuse together in the extreme heat. Gold is not formed in rock so much as it will tend to concentrate under certain geologic conditions. We see evidence of gold grains in some rivers, and nuggets in some rock formations. Gold isn't a rock. It is a chemical element, or, in the eyes of the geologist or miner, it is a mineral. It is \u2026 sometimes referred to as a noble metal because it doesn't react easily with other stuff in the earth. That translates into gold appearing as a pure metal in the form or tiny flakes, nuggets or the like. Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from \u22121 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear. Answer 1: Gold, in its pure form is not made-it occurs naturally in an elemental form. On a side note, the history of alchemy was largely based on the desire of people (probably kings!) to combine other (cheap and abundant) elements and compounds to make gold. Most of the gold products such as jewelry, etc., have a rating in karats, as you probably already know.

The first car was invented in the year of 1769 by a French man named Nicolas Joseph Cugnot, who build it under his instructions in the Paris Arsenal by Mechanic Brezin. The ca \u2026 r only had 3 wheels and was used to carry heavy artilary during war. The car could go up to about 22 miles per hour and was powered by steam The other person who has been credited as the inventor of the car is Gottlieb Daimler but Benz was the one to get his design patented first. Later both of them merged their companies as Daimler-Benz, the company which manufactures the brand cars; Mercedes Benz. Nicholas Cugnot was the one to design and build the first car that was self propelled in 1769 which had three wheels.

Constipation (medical condition): Constipation is any difficulty with bowel movements or unusually dry stool. It is common in children and older age, but can affect anyone. Chronic constipation is a common condition that is characterized by difficult, infrequent, or perceived incomplete evacuation of bowel movements. Symptoms of constipation include having less than 3 bowel movements per week, straining, hard stools, incomplete evacuation and inability to pass stool.

Functional Constipation. Pathogenesis and Management. Constipation is a very common clinical problem, and a questionnaire-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, demonstrated that up to 20% of patients report symptoms consistent with functional constipation. Approximately 40% of such patients have historic evidence of needing to strain excessively to evacuate the bowel.

Exposure to asbestos is the primary cause and risk factor for mesothelioma. Making a correct mesothelioma diagnosis is particularly difficult for doctors because the disease often presents with symptoms that mimic other common ailments. While mesothelioma is typically advanced at diagnosis, treatment options are available. Mesothelioma, while certainly an aggressive disease, is a manageable malignancy. While there is no cure for the cancer, mesothelioma treatment options may potentially include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Mesothelioma is a cancerous or malignant tumour that starts in cells of the mesothelium. Malignant means that it can spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. The mesothelium is a membrane that covers and protects most of your internal organs. It is made up of 2 layers. Mesothelioma is a very rare type of cancer. It most often develops in the pleura, which is called pleural mesothelioma. This type of cancer makes up 70%\u201380% of all mesotheliomas. Cancer can also start in the peritoneum, which is called peritone Mesothelioma (or, more precisely, malignant mesothelioma) is a rare form of cancer that develops from cells of the mesothelium, the protective lining that covers many of the internal organs of the body.

The density of a substance is the relationship between the mass of the substance and how much space it takes up (volume). Density equals the mass of the substance divided by its volume; D = m/v. Objects with the same volume but different mass have different densities. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. A: The formula for calculating density is mass divided by volume (density = mass/volume). Density is a measure of how much mass an object has per a given volume.", "9955": "To clean the keys you can wash them in warm water and/or use some cotton swabs. 2 \u2013 pop all the keys off. 3 \u2013 clean the keys in soapy water. 4 \u2013 clean the keyboard of all the hair, dust and \u2018other\u2019 bits. 5 \u2013 put the keys back on using your photocopy for reference.

The Basophils should remain within the normal range, generally between 0% and 2%. Some clinicians believe that, as in the case of neutrophils, the absolute basophil count is more important than the percentage of basophils and should fall between 0 to 0.3 k/ul.

The number of neutrophil granulocytes or polymorphonuclear cells or white blood cells present in your blood can be measured in terms of Absolute neutrophil count in it. The white blood cells that are measured through absolute neutrophil counts help your body in fighting with infections. The measurement of absolute neutrophil count is done by calculating the total number of white blood cells on the basis of combined percentage of bands immature neutrophil and mature neutrophils. Absolute neutrophil count: The real number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The absolute neutrophil count is commonly called the ANC. The ANC is not measured directly. It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3). WBC count: 6,000 cells/mm3 of blood An abnormal low level of neutrophilis cells is called neutropenia. The number of neutrophils cells in the blood is measured by the absolute neutrophil number count. The neutrophils normal range is considered to be between 2500 and 6000. A number of neutrophils lower than the neutrophils normal range also increases the chances of bacterial infections.

Ferroelectric effect. The ferroelectric effect is an electrical phenomenon whereby certain crystals may exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment (which is called ferroelectric by analogy with ferromagnetic-exhibiting a permanent magnetic moment). The internal electric dipoles of a ferroelectric material are coupled to the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change the strength of the dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. Ferroelectricity is a property of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. It is an example of an improper ferroelectric material in which the phase transition from the paraelectric phase is controlled by the softening of a zone boundary mode, which would lead to a nonpolar low-temperature phase, which is in fact ferroelastic. Virtually all ferroelectric materials need to be electrically poled before use. In the case of LiTaO 3, silver electrodes are applied to faces perpendicular to the polar (c) axis and a pulsed field of about 10 V/cm (1 ms with a 50/50 duty cycle) applied while the crystal is cooled slowly through T C (620 \u00b0C). PZT is the most widely used ferroelectric material in industry as of 2011. It is a hybrid material between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate, which allows formulas for the material to be engineered closer to one or the other ends of the ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric spectrum. The ferroelectric effect draws its name from ferromagnetism, which describes permanent magnetic materials based on iron that are found in nature. This is a bit of a misnomer, however, as most ferroelectric materials are not based upon the element iron. Pyroelectricity (from the Greek pyr, fire, and electricity) is the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary voltage when they are heated or cooled. The change in temperature modifies the positions of the atoms slightly within the crystal structure, such that the polarization of the material changes. Pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity: In a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity, the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another, and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal. In a ferroelectric material, there is a net permanent dipole moment, which comes from the vector sum of dipole moments in each unit cell, \u03c3 \u03bc. This means that it cannot exist in a structure that has a centre of symmetry, as any dipole moment generated in one direction would be forced by symmetry to be zero. Ferroelectric Materials.

Peak flow rate primarily reflects large airway flow and depends on the voluntary effort and muscular strength of the patient. Peak flow measurement is a procedure in which air flowing out of the lungs is measured. The measurement obtained is called the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), or peak expiratory flow (PEF). Peak flow measurement may be obtained using a spirometer, an instrument with a mouth piece that measures the amount of air breathed in and/or out and the rate at which the air is inhaled and expelled from the lungs. Peak flow may also be measured with a peak flow meter (PFM), a portable, hand-held device. Both devices take the measurement as an individual forcefully blows into the mouthpiece of the device.

A peak flow meter is an inexpensive, portable, handheld device for those with asthma that is used to measure how well air moves out of your lungs. Measuring your peak flow using this meter is an important part of managing your asthma symptoms and preventing an asthma attack. The peak flow meter works by measuring how fast air comes out of the lungs when you exhale forcefully after inhaling fully. Peak flow measurement using a peak flow meter is particularly useful for individuals with asthma. During an asthma flare-up, the large airways in the lungs slowly begin to narrow. This slows the speed of air leaving the lungs. Peak flow may also be measured with a peak flow meter (PFM), a portable, hand-held device.

Generally, the salary rates go higher as a nurse gains experience. In the first few years in service, RNs with BSN degrees may earn about $57,280. On the other hand, RNs with an ASN or ADN degree may land entry-level positions that will provide them with $40,250 on average High school \u2013 6%. These stats show that an RN is eligible for 51% of these jobs, while a BSN holder is going to be eligible for 88% of the jobs. Also, the analysis in this study of salary showed that the mean salary for associate\u2019s or RN holders was $66,000, and for those with a BSN, it was $75,000. Education Requirements. Earning your RN with a diploma program usually is a one or two year process. Getting your BSN straight out of high school will take four years. The advantage to earning your RN with a diploma program is that it does not take as much time as a BSN. For example, a hemodialysis nurse with a BSN degree earns $6,000 more than an RN with a ASN degree who works in the same area. RN and BSN Demands and Salary. With all else equal, RNs with BSN degrees receive higher salaries than those with ASN or ADN degrees. In 2011, ADNs earned about $64,000 on average while BSNs made $76,000.

On the other hand, RNs with an ASN or ADN degree may land entry-level positions that will provide them with $40,250 on average Further analysis of those job postings can show the mean real-time salary for the positions posted. For the positions requiring a post-secondary or associate degree the mean salary is $66,620 and for a BSN degree it\u2019s $75,484. Keep in mind that those numbers are for jobs across the spectrum of experience levels. RN vs. BSN: education requirements. The first thing you should know is that becoming an RN means passing the NCLEX exam. There is no way around it. To be eligible to sit for the NCLEX you must first earn either an associate degree in nursing (ADN) or a Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN). A BSN degree augments a nurse\u2019s wages faster than an ADN education would as experience builds up.

The freestanding poles seen by the region's first European explorers were likely preceded by a long history of decorative carving. Where are totem poles carved? Today the lands of the Totem People are known as: 1) southeastern Alaska, USA; 2) coastal British Columbia [B.C.] Canada, and northern Washington state, U.S.A. That's where real totem poles come from. DEFINITION: Totems originally were a series of emblems representing a Northwest Native family-clan, their kinship system, dignity, accomplishments, prestige, adventures, stories, rights and prerogatives. For the full story of totems, purchase Altitude's Totem Poles. The word totem derives from the Algonquian (most likely Ojibwe) word odoodem [ o\u02c8tu\u02d0t\u025bm ], his kinship group. Totem poles are not religious objects, but they do communicate important aspects of native culture. Carvings of animals and other characters typically represent characters or events in a story.

The freestanding poles seen by the region's first European explorers were likely preceded by a long history of decorative carving. Totem poles are sculptures carved from large trees, such as the Western Red Cedar. In North America, totem poles are part of the cultures of many indigenous peoples of Alaska, British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. On these poles, each figure on the totem represents part of a story. These totems are used as a way to record the history and legends of the tribes. Figures on a totem pole are not gods to be worshipped. Instead, they represent traits and characteristics each clan or story embodies. \u2022 TOTEM POLE (noun).

Best Answer: No such thing as a double malt.. Just because there is a single malt doesn't mean there are doubles or triples, etc. The more common types are: Single malt-this is a whisky that's made exclusively of malted barley, at only one distillery, and not blended with anything else. Vatted malt (sometimes called pure malt) - is a blend of single malts, not necessarily from the same distillery. Blended-this is a blend of malt whiskies and grain whiskies. Distilleries that make malt whisky don't usually do both malt *and* grain (such as rye, corn, etc) but some do. Blended whiskies are various combinations of malt and grain, usually from a variety of distilleries Single malt whisky is whisky that has been made from barley (almost always), water and yeast. In single malt whisky only one grain is used, therefore word single can be used to describe the malt whisky. The barley (or other grain) is malted, which is a process of starting the barley seed to sprout by soaking it in water, and then interrupting the process via heat. Single malt whisky is most often associated with the whiskies of Scotland, but Japan, Canada, Germany, Taiwan, India, France, the United States and many other places do produce single malt whiskies. Additionally, single malt whisky is the product of one distillery. A single-malt Lagavulin may contain whiskies from many barrels produced at the Lagavulin distillery, but it will contain only whiskies produced at Lagavulin. A single-grain scotch whisky varies only in that it contains barley and one or more other cereal grains, usually wheat or corn. Formally, however, a blended whisky is a product that contains a mix of barrel-aged malt and grain whiskies. There's a common misconception that because a certain whisky is labeled single malt, it must be the product of just a single batch or barrel of whisky. For example, there is no definition of the term single with relation to whisky in the law of the United States, and some American whiskey advertised as single malt whisky is produced from malted rye rather than malted barley. To be called a single malt whisky in Scotland, a bottle may only contain whisky distilled from malted barley and produced at a single distillery. The regulations of other countries may allow malted rye. (December 2011). A glass of Bowmore 12 Year Old single malt whiskey.

It is also known as a squawker. A mid-range driver is called upon to handle the most significant part of the audible sound spectrum, the region where the most fundamentals emitted by musical instruments and, most importantly, the human voice, lie. Best Answer: In a two-way system there is a woofer and tweeter that together produce the range of frequencies. In a three-way system a mid-range speaker produces a mid-range of frequencies. This places less burden on the woofer and tweeter, typically reducing distortion. However a carefully designed crossover network is normally required for good results. The audio spectrum is the audible frequency range at which humans can hear. The range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and can be effectively broken down into seven different frequency bands, with each having a different impact on the total sound. Midrange: 500 Hz to 2 kHz. The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue. The Mid Range The Mid Range band of frequencies covers two octaves from 500 Hz to 2 kHz. This range can give a horn-like quality to instruments (500 Hz to 1 kHz) and a tinny sound (1 kHz to 2 kHz) or a telephone-like quality (all of the range). Equalization usually centers around 800 Hz and 1,.5 kHz. Covering about 1.5 octaves, from 80 Hz to 250 Hz, this range of frequencies determines the fatness and fullness of the instrument's sound. Equalization is usually applied centered around two frequencies, 100 Hz and 200 Hz. For guitars and bass, the 100 Hz range tends to add body and fullness. The 60hz-90hz range is where we notice the greatest perceptible changes in bass response.. Try a test tone and see just how well you hear 20hz or even 32hz, compared with the same volume of 60hz or 90hz. Mid-Bass. (Approximately 140hz-400hz). Mid bass has lots of instruments included in its frequency range. In statistics, the mid-range or mid-extreme of a set of statistical data values is the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values in a data set, defined as: The mid-range is the midpoint of the range; as such, it is a measure of central tendency. Low Midrange: 250 to 500 Hz. The low midrange contains the low order harmonics of most instruments and is generally viewed as the bass presence range. Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled. Midrange: 500 Hz to 2 kHz. The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue. The woofer driver is responsible for low, bass frequencies. Deep, pulsating notes come from the woofer.

A person with gluten sensitivity (also known as gluten intolerance) may have symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, or diarrhea, but, because the immune or autoimmune symptoms are not involved, it is not considered as serious a condition as celiac disease or gluten allergy. Gliadin is also one of the major allergens associated with wheat allergies and a trigger for celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. Unlike a gluten allergy, in which small amounts of gluten may be tolerated, a patient with celiac disease cannot tolerate any gluten at all. Symptoms of a gluten allergy are often similar to those in celiac disease and may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, bloating, heartburn, bloating, anxiety and anemia.

She talks about the good and bad about each one and tells you what she chooses to use for chicken bedding. Bedding is an important part of keeping your chickens happy and healthy. On the coop floor the bedding will provide a soft surface for your chickens to walk on and will absorb droppings and odor. You want your coop sanitary and sweet-smelling, don't you? In the nest, bedding will give freshly-laid eggs a soft landing so they don't crack. Mortar sand is recommended (it is less dusty). Other types of sand may have fines, or very fine dust, that can be irritating to your chickens' lungs. In your brooder, remember that even baby chicks are big poopers, so make sure you have plenty of bedding, and change it often. A layer of bedding also acts as a soft surface for the chickens\u2019 feet and to keep the birds warm. A good layer of bedding should also be placed in the nesting boxes to provide comfort for the hen when she lays and to protect the eggs. Whatever type of bedding you choose always keep it as clean and as dry as possible as the happier and more comfortable your chickens are the more eggs they will give you.

Parasitic infection is contamination of one organism with another living organism that then begins to feed off or reside in the initial organism. The Giardia parasite can be ingested by drinking untreated water. Diarrhea and vomiting may result from a parasitic infection. Parasites often infect a person's gastrointestinal tract. Stool samples that are collected at home are usually placed into plastic containers. Parasitic infections can be caused by three types of organisms: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites. Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can live and multiply inside of humans. Some infections caused by protozoa include giardiasis. Not every parasitic infection has a treatment, and some infections can recur. Trichomoniasis can be treated with antibiotics. Giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis can also be treated with medications. Toxoplamosis is usually not treated with a medication unless it is severe and prolonged. Drugs that eliminate parasites are available for most infections. A parasite is an organism that lives on or inside another organism (the host) and harms the host. Parasitic infections are common in rural or developing areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America and are less common in developed areas. A person who visits such an area can unknowingly acquire a parasitic infection, and a doctor may not readily diagnose the infection when the person returns home. Overview. Parasites are microorganisms that live off of other organisms, or hosts, to survive. Some parasites don\u2019t affect the host.

If you're calculating for Cubic Feet or Cubic Yards of Concrete needed, you will need to convert your inch measurements to Engineers Scale. Engineers scale is basically taking a foot (12 inches) and converting it into10ths. The engineers scale also eliminates the fractions of an inch. How to Measure Concrete to Be Poured. Measuring the area where Concrete will be placed to calculate how many Cubic Yards, Cubic feet (or Cubic Meters) will be needed. Step 1. Measure the overall area into which the concrete for the slab will be poured. In this case the slab is 12 feet wide by 14 feet long. Multiplying the two measurements, the area is equal to 168 square feet. Overview. All concrete is sold by the cubic yard. A cubic yard is equal to a cube that is three feet wide by three feet high by three feet deep. The total volume is equal to 27 cubic feet. To calculate the volume of concrete you need, you must measure the surface area of the slab and multiply this by the thickness of the slab. You usually measure the length and width of the slab in feet, thus giving you a value for area in square feet when you multiply them, but you usually measure thickness in inches. When ordering concrete for a large project, such as the slab for a new garage, you need to quote the amount you need in cubic yards. For smaller projects, such as the floor for a garden shed, cubic feet is a more appropriate unit. Instructions. Measure the dimensions of your site--length, width, depth--in feet. These measurements are all that are required for a typical site, ie. slabs, but take all relevant measurements for irregular shapes. Measure twice, to ensure accuracy Use the slab calculator to figure the concrete needed for the porch surface. Use the footing calculator to calculate the sides of the porch and the steps. Here is an example: This porch has 9 sq. feet of porch surface, so enter in the slab calculator 4 thickness by 3' width by 3' length. Atlanta Brick & Concrete in Atlanta, GA Use this concrete calculator as a quick and easy way to determine how much concrete you will need.

The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as adhesive in the papermaking process. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin.

Carbohydrates -- a key source of energy for your body and the preferred source for your brain -- are broken down during digestion by an enzyme called amylase into single sugars like glucose. Starches are one of the three types of carbohydrates, along with fiber and sugars. When people talk about limiting carbs, they are often talking about limiting their consumption of starchy foods. Foods that are considered starchy include grains, legumes and starchy vegetables such as potatoes, corn, peas, winter squash and sweet potatoes. These foods often contain at least a small amount of sugar and fiber as well as starch When you consume foods that contain starch, it becomes an important source of energy for your body. Starches, or complex carbs, consist of two molecules -- amylose and amylopectin -- that connect together to form starch granules. Amylose and amylopectin have different characteristics, which define the different types of starches. There are several types of resistant starches.

It would be easy to get swept up in the broad intellectual scope of bioarchaeology, but what it all comes down to is this -- the bones. Human bodies are notoriously fragile in the face of decomposition. When we die, our flesh quickly degrades due to environmental conditions and microbes that feed on our remains. For the most part, our hard, durable skeletons are all that's left of us, and even those begin to break down over time. So bones, in essence, become centerpieces of evidence as bioarchaeologists work to unravel mysteries about ancient peoples.

Acerola cherries provide more vitamin C than all other food sources, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Acerola juice is such a rich source that MedlinePlus warns against drinking the juice if you also take vitamin C supplements. Origin: The acerola is believed to originate from the Yucatan (linguistic evidence) and is distributed from South Texas, through Mexico (especially on the West Coast from Sonora to Guerrero) and Central America to northern South America (Venezuela, Surinam, Columbia) and throughout the Caribbean (Bahamas to Trinidad). Pests and Disease: The Acerola is susceptible to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) which causes serious problems with young trees and slower losses of productivity in older trees.

Get one microscope for your lab group and carry it to your lab desk with two hands. Make sure that the low power objective is in position and that the diaphragm is open to the widest setting.2. Obtain a prepared slide of an onion root tip (there will be three root tips on a slide). Hold the slide up to the light to see the pointed ends of the root sections. This is the root tip where the cells were actively dividing Making the world better, one answer at a time. Root tips of allium cepa (otherwise known as the onion) are popularly used for cytological studies all over the world for the following reasons: 1) Roots are easy to grow from the base of the bulb kept over a water container. 2) Good quality, unsoiled root tips are easy to obtain. Mitosis takes place in the root tip cells. The root tip of a healthy plant is growing r \u2026 apidly and there is a requirement for many newly formed cells. 1 person found this useful. These regions of growth are good for studying the cell cycle because at any given time, you can find cells that are undergoing mitosis. In order to examine cells in the tip of an onion root, a thin slice of the root is placed onto a microscope slide and stained so the chromosomes will be visible. The cells you'll be looking at in this activity were photographed with a light microsope and then digitized so you can see them on the computer. Mitosis is the name for the kind of cell division that produces a greater number of cells = cell multiplication; after division, the daughter cells are about half the size of their parent, and they grow before division occurs again. Most of the time a cell is in interphase, the growth and preparation stage of the cycle. Mitosis, the actual process of dividing has four defined phases: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase; then the daughter cells enter interphase. 4.

Korematsu had been arrested by the FBI for failing to report for relocation and was convicted in federal court in September 1942.

In defiance of the order, Fred Korematsu, an American-born citizen of Japanese descent, refused to leave his home in San Leandro, California. Duly convicted, he appealed, and in 1944 his case reached the Supreme Court. Gibbons v. Ogden(1824). was a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the power to regulate interstate commerce was granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The case was argued by some of America's most admired and capable attorneys at the time. United States v. Nixon, (1974). was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision. It was a unanimous 8-0 ruling falling against President Richard Nixon and was important to the late stages of the Watergate scandal. It is considered a crucial precedent limiting the power of any U.S. president. His case went to the Supreme Court where it was decided that exclusion orders based on Executive Order 9066 were in fact constitutional. Therefore, his conviction was upheld. Significance of Korematsu v. United States: The Korematsu decision was significant because it ruled that the United States government had the right to exclude and forcibly move people from designated areas based on their race. The decision was 6-3 that the need to protect the United States from espionage and other wartime acts was more important than Korematsu's individual rights. Even though Korematsu's conviction was eventually overturned in 1983, the Korematsu ruling concerning the creation of exclusion orders has never been overturned.

The soybean aphid is an exotic pest of soybean (Glycine max) accidentally introduced into the United States from Asia. It was first detected in the Midwestern U.S. in 2000 and in Pennsylvania in 2001. The life history of many aphids is complex and unusual. Enormous populations of aphids can be built up in a short period of time. Although considerable variation occurs between species, a typical life history is described as follows. Aphids generally overwinter as fertilized eggs.hey feed on both coniferous and deciduous plants. Effective control of aphids has been a problem to homeowners and landscape managers for years. Some of the more common aphids include the green peach aphid, melon aphid, tuliptree aphid, giant bark aphid, white pine aphid, and rose aphid. Many species of aphids or plant lice occur on ornamental trees and shrubs in Pennsylvania. Certain species feed on foliage, others on twigs and branches, flowers or fruit, and some on roots.

It\u2019s a sacrilege to compare honey to refined sugar, yes they are both sweet but that\u2019s where the similarity ends. Honey is not fattening, simply because it\u2019s a natural, whole food while sugar is a processed, nutrition-less, carbohydrate source. What your body doesn't use right away gets stored as fat. Honey is also made mostly of sugar, but it's only about 30 percent glucose and less than 40 percent fructose. And there are also about 20 other sugars in the mix, many of which are much more complex, and dextrin, a type of starchy fiber. When honey is in its natural state, it is made up of carbohydrates that are formed from glucose, fructose, maltose and a bit of sucrose. But, these carbohydrates are only present in conjunction with niacin, riboflavin, zinc, copper, manganese, iron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. Honey is a type of sugar and contains calories. In fact, there are more calories in honey than in table sugar. One teaspoon of table sugar contains 16 calories. One teaspoon of honey contains 22 calories. A close-up of bottles of honey.

Honey's intense sweetness makes it satisfying in small amounts. Best Answer: Honey is not fattening per say. It is better than sugar in that it doesn't raise your blood sugar as fast and it does have some nutritional value to it. But really it comes down to a calorie content and honey still does have a decent amount of calories. Studies have been conducted that have indicated that honey is not fattening at all.

The male organ known as an anther generates the pollen grains containing male genetic material. In most flowers, anthers are located at the tip of a stalk known as a stamen. Fertilization. Fertilization, which is the union of sperm and egg, occurs deep within the flower after pollination. When a pollen grain lands on the stigma, it generates a tiny tube tipped with sperm. The tube fits into a conduit called a style in the female pistil. Seeds vs Pollen. A seed can be considered as the plant itself which is covered by a seed coat, more often than not with some food stored inside. It is the end product of the action of angiosperm and gymnosperm plants after fertilization has occurred. The embryo is the point where the new plant can grow when put in the most ideal propagating conditions. It can have one seed leaf (as in the case of monocotyledons) or two in dicots. The second part of a seed is called the nutrient supply for the embryo which in most cases is called the endosperm. Explaining the differences between bee pollen and flower pollen. Flower pollen is created when plants produce flowers. It is the male germ seed (sperm) of plants. Pollination occurs when the pollen is carried by bees, wind, or other means from the flower's stamen to the stigma of another flower's pistil. Fertilization results when the pollen reaches the ovary of the plant. This is when a seed is created Email.

During pollination, pollen grains from a flower fall on the stigma of the same flower or another flower. They are stimulated by a sugary fluid on the stigma and starts germinating. The intine of the pollen grain grows out through a small pore in the extine to produce the pollen tube. Best Answer: Pollination is the process of transfering the pollen grain from anther to stigma of the flower. The fertilization product would be an ovary (fruit) with ovule inside (seed). Pollination is transfering a single cell while seed is a multicellular cell. pollination is when the plant is fertilized by another plants pollen through bugs or wind or something and seed dispersal is how the plant spreads its seeds like how a dandelion has the seeds with the little white fuzzy thing at the end that alows the wind to carry it pretty far.

A nitrogenous base, which can be either adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine (in the case of RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil). Overview [edit]. A DNA nucleotide is composed of 3 main units: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. While the sugar and phosphate group alternate in sequence and form the backbone of the DNA double helix, the nitrogenous bases may differ in every adjoining nucleotide. The four nitrogenous bases present in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). In RNA, the only differing nitrogenous base is uracil (U) (which replaces thymine in DNA and differs thymine only by the missing methyl group at carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring) These nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the twisted ladder or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs. The main biological function of a nitrogenous base is to bond nucleic acids together. A nitrogenous, or nitrogen-containing, base is an organic molecule with a nitrogen atom that has the chemical properties of a base. A nitrogenous base owes its basic properties to the lone pair of electrons of a nitrogen atom. 1 In RNA, Adenine binds to Uracil. 2 These hydrogen-bond interactions between nucleotides C-G and A-T or A-U are referred to as base-pairing or complementary base-pairing. 3 Base-pairing holds the double-stranded DNA molecule together. 4 Base-pairing is necessary for DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and Protein synthesis to occur. At left is an unfolded view of a double-stranded DNA molecule, showing the two chains of nucleotides, connected in the center by a series of hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases. At right, a schematic illustration showing the arrangement of the two strands in the double-helix configuration. A phosphodiester bond forms between nucleotides to form nucleic acids. Problem: Name the bond that forms between nucleotide groups. While hydrogen bonds do contribute a small amount to the stability of helices, their main contribution is to the specificity of a helix.

Indigenous Aboriginal paint was traditionally made from ochre, which are natural earth pigments from rocks. In rock form, the ochre has a crumbly to hard texture, the rock that ochre comes from is heavily coloured by iron oxide and includes the colours yellow, red and brown. Traditional Aboriginal Painting Methods. Contemporary Aboriginal artists use a considerable variety of materials and techniques in painting.

As a result, it\u2019s hard to generalize how to care for these types of orchid From a botanist's point of view, there are only two orchid types: Terrestrial orchids and Epiphytes. The distinction between these orchid types is as follows. The orchids varieties or the species that grow on the ground come under the terrestrial orchid types. On the other hand, orchid species that grow on trees or rocks, come under epiphytic orchid types. Let's take a look at some of these types of orchids. 1 In China, some of the orchid types are used as aphrodisiacs. 2 In tropics, different types of orchids are found in the cloud forests in mountainous regions, while they are less in numbers, at lower elevations, in the rain forests. These plants reward their orchid growers with an extravagant display of colorful blooms. They seem to be sending back out the very sun they soak up. Phalaenopsis: Phalaenopsis orchids, or \u201cmoth orchids\u201d, are ever popular among beginner growers because they\u2019re one of the most resilient and sturdy orchid types out there. They can survive many of the inevitable beginner\u2019s mistakes that would kill less hearty plants, and their blossoms put on a great show to boot. Originally, this genus included all epiphytic orchids. As knowledge of the different types of orchids expanded, the classification became much more refined; for example, there are now some terrestrial species in the Epidendrum genus, and a great many other species have been moved to other genera. Catasetum orchids, along with the other members of the Catasetum alliance, have big, thick pseudobulbs with an attractive fan of thin leaves along their length. The flowers can be very showy, but are unisexual, so that male and female flowers look different. Lighting affects which kind appears Orchids are lovely, complex and diverse flowers. They come in a stunning array of varieties, with nearly every color shape and size imaginable represented. There are many orchid types, approximately 26,000 species and about 880 categories or genera in the world. Since orchids grow on every continent one could say they are one of the most diverse species of flowers. Their structure is unique to the species, and no other flower looks quite like an orchid. 1 Phalaenopsis \u2013 Phalaenopsis, otherwise known as the moth orchid, this is perhaps the most common of various orchid flowers you can buy in a general garden center. 2 Moth orchids bloom once or twice a year, and each flower can last as long as three months with the proper care, and are the longest-lasting of orchid blooms. The variety of orchid plant types is amazing. Some bloom for weeks at a time, while others keep their flowers an amazing four months or more.

Nike emanated from two sources: Bill Bowerman's quest for lighter, more durable racing shoes for his Oregon runners, and Knight's search for a way to make a living without having to give up his love of athletics. Bowerman coached track at the University of Oregon where Phil Knight ran in 1959. That same year Nike's revenues were a staggering $6.74 billion. Expecting $8 billion sales in fiscal 1997, Nike has targeted $12 billion in sales by the year 2000. And all from the back of a car. Few can question Nike's financial hegemony. He was 88.

The success rates of neck and back surgery depend on several factors, such as the condition being treated, the severity of the condition and the type of surgery performed. Just as there are several potential sources of neck and back discomfort, there are also many types of spine surgery. To learn more about the success rates of traditional open back surgery, as opposed to the success rates at Laser Spine Institute, or for more information about the minimally invasive spine procedures we offer, contact us to determine if you are a candidate for one of our procedures. By definition, surgeons report very high success rates. Patients report success as whether their pain was relieved. The success of pain reduction is shockingly low. For instance, spine surgeons often quote a 98% success rate for fusion surgery. This percentage refers to the fusion process, not the reduction of pain. For single level fusions, the percentage of patients obtaining significant relief is approximately 40%. With three levels this drops to 15%. Neurosurgeons give microdiscectomy a 95-98% success rate; however when success is defined as returning to their previous occupations without pain medications, the overall success rate plummets to 29%. Among spinal surgery patients, one out of every four patients is dissatisfied with their surgery two years post-op. For instance, spine surgeons often quote a 98% success rate for fusion surgery. This percentage refers to the fusion process, not the reduction of pain. For single level fusions, the percentage of patients obtaining significant relief is approximately 40%. With three levels this drops to 15%. Back surgery for a pinched nerve can usually be done with a minimally invasive approach, and will usually result in early return to normal function (1 to 3 weeks). The success rate for decompression spine surgery is high, with approximately 90% of patients experiencing good relief of the leg pain after the surgery. Surgery to treat low back pain can be a far more extensive type of back surgery, with a longer healing period and a somewhat lower success rate, than back surgery for a pinched nerve (leg pain). Patients must carefully consider the decision to undergo back surgery. The spine is a difficult and delicate place to operate and surgeons are only sometimes able to lessen pain and improve movement, which is why doctors strongly recommend patients seek a second opinion before making a choice. It felt like a knife was being put in my back.. The surgeon gave Kramer low odds on the surgery succeeding. It was like 85 to 1585 that it would not cure the pain, and 15, or maybe 20, that it would, says Kramer. There may be a number of reasons why a back operation is not successful. Back surgery might be an option if conservative treatments haven't worked and your pain is persistent and disabling. Back surgery often more predictably relieves associated pain or numbness that goes down one or both arms or legs. These symptoms often are caused by compressed nerves in your spine. Back pain is extremely common, and surgery often fails to relieve it. Find out why your back hurts and whether surgery might help. Back surgery can help relieve some causes of back pain, but it's rarely necessary. Most back pain resolves on its own within two months.

The Missouri Compromise was an agreement between the North and the South and passed by Congress in 1820 that allowed Missouri to be admitted as the 24th state in 1821.

Prohibition of slavery in Missouri, January 12, 1820. The compromise was agreed to by both the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States Congress and passed as a law in 1820, under the presidency of James Monroe. The Missouri Compromise was effectively repealed by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, submitted to Congress by Stephen A. Douglas in January 1854.

This was the work of Gordon Teal, an expert in growing crystals of high purity, who had previously worked at Bell Labs. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. (Industrial Development Engineering Associates) of Indianapolis, Indiana, was the first practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers. The TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 and put on sale in November 1954 for $49.95 (the equivalent of about $361 in year-2005 dollars) and sold about 150,000 units. The way I provided the name, was to think of what the device did. And at that time, it was supposed to be the dual of the vacuum tube. The vacuum tube had transconductance, so the transistor would have 'transresistance.' And the name should fit in with the names of other devices, such as varistor and thermistor. And. 1947: Invention of the Transistor. The first transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories on December 16, 1947 by William Shockley (seated at Brattain's laboratory bench), John Bardeen (left) and Walter Brattain (right). The picture on the left above shows the first point contact transistor built by Walter Brattain. It consisted of a plastic triangle lightly suspended above a germanium crystal which itself was sitting on a metal plate attached to a voltage source. Vacuum tubes were made containing several three terminal devices called triodes. The transistor is a three terminal, solid state electronic device. In a three terminal device we can control electric current or voltage between two of the terminals by applying an electric current or voltage to the third terminal. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals changes the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. The first high-frequency transistor was the surface-barrier germanium transistor developed by Philco in 1953, capable of operating up to 60 MHz. These were made by etching depressions into an N-type germanium base from both sides with jets of Indium(III) sulfate until it was a few ten-thousandths of an inch thick. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current.

IGMP is an integral part of IP multicast. A Layer 2 switch supporting IGMP Snooping can passively snoop on IGMP Query, Report, and Leave (IGMP version 2) packets transferred between IP Multicast routers/switches and IP Multicast hosts to determine the IP Multicast group membership. Without IGMP Querying/Snooping, Multicast traffic is treated in the same manner as a Broadcast transmission, which forwards packets to all ports on the network. Usually, there are 2 things you need to do: 1. enable IGMP snooping. 2. add a router and enable PIM. or if the switch supports it, enable the switch as a IGMP querier. Note that Windows Server can also act as an IGMP querier. Although its best if the switch does it. Cant say I've seen it on a real cisco switch (doesnt mean its not there), but my linksys by cisco managed switch can do it, even though its undocumented. Oh, i forgot, also watch the multicast address you use. With Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping, Layer 2 devices also can make intelligent multicast forwarding decisions by examining the contents of each frame\u2019s Layer 3 IP header. Consider the example of a heterogeneous Layer 2 and Layer 3 network that does not use IGMP snooping. While the IGMP protocol provides some limited ability to create or extend multicast-enabled IP internetworks, it is not the equivalent of a multicast routing protocol, such as DVMRP or PIM. Do not use the Windows 2000 IGMP routing protocol to create a multicast-enabled IP internetwork of an arbitrary size or topology. Because there are no multicast routing protocols provided with Windows 2000, the maintenance of entries in the IP multicast forwarding table is a function of IGMP, a component that is added as an IP routing protocol. IGMP snooping allows a switch to only forward multicast traffic to the links that have solicited them. Essentially, IGMP snooping is a layer 2 optimization for the layer 3 IGMP. IGMP snooping takes place internally on switches and is not a protocol feature. IGMP querier [edit]. In order for IGMP, and thus IGMP snooping, to function, a multicast router must exist on the network and generate IGMP queries. The tables created for snooping (holding the member ports for each a multicast group) are associated with the querier. IGMP snooping is the process of listening to Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) network traffic. The feature allows a network switch to listen in on the IGMP conversation between hosts and routers. By listening to these conversations the switch maintains a map of which links need which IP multicast streams. IGMP querier [edit]. In order for IGMP, and thus IGMP snooping, to function, a multicast router must exist on the network and generate IGMP queries. The tables created for snooping (holding the member ports for each a multicast group) are associated with the querier. Note: In order to maintain group membership, the multicast router sends a IGMP query every 60 seconds. This query is intercepted by the switch, and forwarded to all ports on the switch. All hosts that are members of the group answer that query. The second solution is to use CGMP, which is a Cisco proprietary protocol that runs between the multicast router and the switch. CGMP enables the Cisco multicast router to understand IGMP messages sent by hosts, and informs the switch about the information contained in the IGMP packet.

What's Measured. Both BMR, and RMR, estimate the number of calories you burn at rest, but RMR takes additional factors into consideration when determining needs. BMR measures your basal energy expenditure, or BEE. BMR is taken first thing in the morning, after eight hours of sleep and a 12 hour fast while the subject is lying down. RMR does not require a sleepover, and is measured at any time of day following a three to four hour fast. The rate at which these processes occur is measured in calories per unit of time, and is most often given in calories per day. The term basal metabolic rate (BMR) is often confused and/or interchanged with RMR or resting energy expenditure (REE). 1 After age 20, BMR is estimated to drop about 2 percent to 3 percent each decade. 2 Weight. 3 The more an individual weighs, the higher his or her BMR will be. 4 For example, the metabolic rate of very overweight individuals is generally higher than that of their normal-weight counterparts. Or put another way, metabolic rate is an estimate of how many calories you would burn if you were to do nothing but rest for 24 hours. It represents the minimum amount of energy required to keep your body functioning. BMR is defined as Basal Metabolic Rate. BMR is synonymous with Basal Energy Expenditure or BEE. BMR measurements are typically taken in a darkened room upon waking after 8 hours of sleep, 12 hours of fasting to ensure that the digestive system is inactive, and with the subject resting in a reclined position. RMR can be defined as Resting Metabolic Rate. RMR is synonymous with Resting Energy Expenditure or REE. RMR measurements are typically taken under less restricted conditions than BMR and do not require that the subject spend the night sleeping in the test facility prior to testing. By Mark P. Kelly, Ph.D. Unless you have been living on an island or mountaintop somewhere (or simply don\u2019t watch television), you\u2019ve undoubtedly seen numerous infomercials talking about resting metabolic rate (RMR) and how one exercise or another will increase it, causing body fat to just melt away. 1 After age 20, BMR is estimated to drop about 2 percent to 3 percent each decade. 2 Weight. 3 The more an individual weighs, the higher his or her BMR will be. 4 For example, the metabolic rate of very overweight individuals is generally higher than that of their normal-weight counterparts. When comparing calorie estimations, RMR is slightly higher than BMR, but the difference is less than 10 percent, according to the National Research Council. While both RMR and BMR are considered estimations of your calorie needs, BMR is a more accurate measure because of the stricter procedures required to obtain it. BMR is taken first thing in the morning, after eight hours of sleep and a 12 hour fast while the subject is lying down. RMR does not require a sleepover, and is measured at any time of day following a three to four hour fast.

Specially contoured solid trays with louvers that permit oil rapid return. Proper oil control can contribute up to 20 HP on street engines and even more on race engines. Made in USA. A wind-age tray is usually a stamped piece of sheet metal that is mounted between the crank shaft and the oil pan. On slow revving i.e. stock applications there benefit is slight. However race and high RPM applications claim that they actually free up more horsepower. A wind-age tray acts like a scraper and removes the oil from the vortex letting it drain back to the oil pan. It does not actually touch the crank shaft but it is close enough to it to skim off the oil and let it drain. Oil control is extremely important for power and durability. I use Esslingers windage tray, and am convinced that it will contribute to a significant reduction of HP loss due to oil whipping around, and trying to follow the action of the crankshaft. We are using ARP main cap studs and a windage tray. The tray came from Racer Walsh, but looks identical to the one offered by Esslinger Engineering. It is a very nice unit and comes with 4 main cap bolts with a small stud protrusion on the head. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by David Theiler. Confidence votes 17.4K. That is a medal tray that is bolted to the main caps on the bottom of the engine that is designed to keep the engine oil from splashing up in the engine and stop the oil pump pick-up tube from sucking air instead of oil. It also stops the engine oil from foaming in the oil pan due to splashing.

They were widely used in x-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical electrotherapy devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Electromagnetic induction was first discovered by Michael Faraday, who made his discovery public in 1831. It was discovered independently by Joseph Henry in 1832. When the coils are stationary, no current is induced. But when the small coil is moved in or out of the large coil (B) , the magnetic flux through the large coil changes, inducing a current which is detected by the galvanometer (G) . 1821 The first electric motor was invented by Michael Faraday. 1826 Georg Ohm defined the relationship between power, voltage, current and resistance in \u201cOhms Law.\u201d. 1831 Using his invention the induction ring, Michael Faraday proved that electricity can be induced (made) by changes in an electromagnetic field. Credit: Wikimedia Commons. Electricity is a form of energy and it occurs in nature, so it was not \u201cinvented.\u201d As to who discovered it, many misconceptions abound. Some give credit to Benjamin Franklin for discovering electricity, but his experiments only helped establish the connection between lightning and electricity, nothing more. Others who worked to bring the use of electricity to where it is today include Scottish inventor James Watt, Andre Ampere, a French mathematician, and German mathematician and physicist George Ohm. And so, it was not just one person who discovered electricity. In 1831, the English scientist Michael Faraday discovered that an electrical current could be induced in a copper wire by a moving magnetic field. This led to two crucial inventions: the dynamo and the electric motor. It had been evolved by many Europeans and in 1852 the first 'modern' light bulb was invented. Edison bought his patent in the 1870s from other inventors and experimented with different filaments. Quite ironic as this pages is about the misconception of who first harnessed electricity. The sweeping of the conductor by that expanding magnetic field will set up an emf that will oppose the emf that was creating it. Comment Technically, there is no such thing as an 'induced current'. It is voltage that is induced. Any current flows as a result of that induced voltage being applied to a load. Voltage (emf) causes current flow, and this induced voltage will cause a current that is called the induced current \u2026 . We might also add that the induced current will cause a magnetic field to expand about the current path, and this field will sweep the conductor. a current can be induced by changing the area of a coil in a constant magnetic field. By Faraday's Law: the induced current is proportional to the rate of the change of flux i \u2026 n a loop of wire. With magnetic flux being defined as the product of the magnitude of the magnetic field and the area of the loop. Strictly speaking, you will only get an induced current in the wire if it is part of a complete circuit. A wire which is unconnected at both ends will have a difference in voltage between the ends (a potential difference) but current can only flow when the wire is in a circuit. Electromagnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across a conductor exposed to time varying magnetic fields.

It is situated behind the Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo) after the Cathedral and the Baptistery. The tower's tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The Tower is located behind the cathedral and is said to be the third oldest structure in Pisa. The tower was made to stand straight, however immediately after it was constructed, it started leaning towards the south east. The Tower Of Pisa was built over a period spanning from 1173 to 1372 and was constructed in three different phases. It was in 1178 when the Leaning Tower of Pisa had three floors that the tower started to sink. The reason was that only a three meter foundation had been used upon unbalanced soil.

With Provera, you are not supposed to start bleeding until after you have taken all ten doses. This is because Provera mimics the rise in progesterone at ovulation. The reason they give you 10 days it that it mimics a natural luteal phase. The drop in progesterone is what causes you to start your period.

If you have shingles symptoms, get treatment now and you may avoid permanent nerve pain. Shingles, a viral infection of the nerve roots, affects 1 million people in the U.S each year. Most people recover from their bout, but for as many as 50% of those over age 60 who have not been treated, the pain doesn't go away. But in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. This is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. When it comes back, the virus can cause shingles, a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. Early shingles symptoms can include: 1 Headache. 2 Light sensitivity. 3 Flu-like symptoms without fever Shingles is a disease that affects nerves and causes pain and blisters in adults. It is caused by the same varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus does not leave your body, but continues to live in some nerve cells. It causes a painful rash. You can only get shingles if you had chickenpox in the past. After you have chickenpox (usually as a child), the virus that causes it stays in your body in certain nerve cells. Most of the time your immune system keeps the chickenpox virus in these cells. In a few days, these bumps turn into blisters. You might feel a stinging or burning pain. The rash may wrap around your back and chest, or it may be on one side of your face. The blisters usually crust over and fall off after 7 to 10 days. You may see changes in the color of your skin when the scabs fall off. In bad cases of shingles, these color changes last forever.

More than likely, you are not too far from a deciduous tree right now. Deciduous trees are trees that drop their leaves for part of the year. They are found in temperate and tropical climates all over the world. Deciduous trees have broad flat leaves that catch a lot of light and require a great amount of water. In some cases, leaf loss coincides with winter-namely in temperate or polar climates when there is less sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. Many deciduous plants flower during the period when they are leafless, as this increases the effectiveness of pollination. The absence of leaves improves wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants and increases the visibility of the flowers to insects in insect-pollinated plants. A number of deciduous plants remove nitrogen and carbon from the foliage before they are shed and store them in the form of proteins in the vacuoles of parenchyma cells in the roots and the inner bark. In botany and horticulture, deciduous plants, including trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials, are those that lose all of their leaves for part of the year. This process is called abscission. In some cases leaf loss coincides with winter \u2014 namely in temperate or polar climates. A number of deciduous plants remove nitrogen and carbon from the foliage before they are shed and store them in the form of proteins in the vacuoles of parenchyma cells in the roots and the inner bark. Definition: Deciduous is a designation indicating a plant sheds its foliage at the end of the growing season.

According to the self-medication hypothesis (SMH), the individuals' choice of a particular drug is not accidental or coincidental, but instead, a result of the individuals' psychological condition, as the drug of choice provides relief to the user specific to his or her condition. For other uses, see Self-medication (disambiguation) . Self-medication is a human behavior in which an individual uses a substance or any exogenous influence to self-administer treatment for physical or psychological ailments.

Self Medication Theory of Addiction. The self-medication theory of addiction suggests that it is this attempt to self-soothe with alcohol and drugs that eventually leads to addiction. Once the individual realizes that these substances give them some relief they can start to abuse them more and more. The self-medication theory of addiction suggests that the individual will be attracted to different substances on the basis of their symptoms: * People with symptoms of anxiety can be attracted to alcohol or sedative type drugs because they produce feelings of relaxation. This is mental health awareness month. Which means, in my experience, that it is still, to some extent at least, alcohol awareness month. Many people who suffer with undiagnosed depression or anxiety reach for alcohol or drugs to calm their nerves or relieve them of emotional pain. In other words, they self-medicate. Rather than seek out some help in managing depression, anxiety or chronic resentment, they seek their own solution -- a solution which, while it works pretty well for a while, eventually complicates the issues and leads to more pain. Recreational Drugs. Other ways to self-medicate for depression can include the use of drugs and these might be either pharmaceutical or recreational. The use of recreational drugs to treat depression will often mean using ecstasy/MDMA which causes euphoria and thereby can improve mood to a great degree. Self-Medication for Pain.

The wild turkey is the largest game bird in North America. Male turkeys (\u201cgobblers\u201d) are between 2 \u00bd and 3 feet tall and weigh on average 16 pounds (with some individuals weighing in considerably larger!). Female turkeys (\u201chens\u201d) are on average 2 feet tall with average weights of 9 to 10 pounds. Wild turkeys do not mate for life. They do not even maintain a pair bond for one season. Breeding is promiscuous and the gobblers (adult males) will breed with as many hens as possible during the mating period. Although the wild turkey, as a species, had nothing to do with the country of Turkey, it is certain that the word turkey derives from that land.

Once you have decided on the retail pricing of your products, compare the sales prices with the wholesale costs to determine your expected profit margin. Profit margin can be listed both in dollar terms and as a percentage. For example, a product will sell for $25 each and your wholesale cost is $10. The profit margin will be $15 per sale. As a percentage, the profit margin is 15 divided by 25, or 60 percent. Profit margin is always calculated from the retail price and is the money coming in to run your business Markup can be expressed as a fixed amount or as a percentage of the total cost or selling price. Retail markup is commonly calculated as the difference between wholesale price and retail price, as a percentage of wholesale. Other methods are also used Restaurants. Large markup percentages drive up the cost of eating out, especially for beverages and cheaper ingredients, like pasta. MSN reports that the average markup for a food item is about 60%, and a restaurant may mark up a nonalcoholic beverage by as much as 500%. Restaurants do, however, have very high overhead costs and keep only $0.04 of every dollar the customer spends. Using Markup to Calculate Selling Price. Here's a formula for calculating markup by percentage: Selling price = [(Cost) \u00f7 (100 - percentage markup)] \u00d7 100. Say you buy a sweater at wholesale for $60 and need to sell it at a 60 percent markup. The calculation would be [($60) \u00f7 (100 - 60)] x 100. This breaks down to ($60 \u00f7 40) x 100, resulting in a selling price of $150. Apparel markups are somewhat above the standard retail markup of two times cost, which is known as keystone in the retail industry, according to Forbes.. Typical markup on designer fashions ranges from 55 to 62 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal.. If the wholesale price of a silk dress is $50, the retail price might range from around $110 to $130. Premium denim jeans often wholesale for around $150 and may sell at retail for up to $375 The markup from the wholesale price you pay for goods to the retail price at which you sell those goods is the lifeblood of your business. You want to set prices that are competitive and at the same time make enough profit margin to cover your costs and leave a profit for the business. Once you have decided on the retail pricing of your products, compare the sales prices with the wholesale costs to determine your expected profit margin. Profit margin can be listed both in dollar terms and as a percentage. For example, a product will sell for $25 each and your wholesale cost is $10. The profit margin will be $15 per sale. As a percentage, the profit margin is 15 divided by 25, or 60 percent. Profit margin is always calculated from the retail price and is the money coming in to run your Markup as a Percentage of Cost or Selling Price. Markup can be expressed as a percentage of cost or of selling price. Consider an item that costs the seller $50 and retails for $100. This is a 100-percent markup over cost, but in terms of the selling price it is only a 50-percent markup. Retailers typically express markup as a percentage of selling price. The example shown is a Mark-On. The markup in the example is a 50% markup, meaning that of the retail price 50% is markup and 50% is cost. The correct forumula to computer Retail selling price is. Cost / (1 \u2013 Markup) where markup is expressed as a decimal value. A 50 percent markup would be 0.50. To arrive at the selling price, take the cost and divide by (1-.50) or .50 which is to double the cost. A 35 percent markup on a 100 item is $100 / (1 \u2013 0.35) = $100 / .65 = $153.85/.", "13131": "A Bronsted-Lowry base is a solution that behaves as proton acceptors, and these protons are in the form of a hydrogen (H+) ion.", "13132": "4 hours on med-high for a 2-lb roast, and 1 additional hour per pound, up to approximately 8 hours.", "13133": "Use a hammer and center punch to drive out the hinge pins, if they are accessible.", "13134": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "13135": "759,366.", "13136": "34503 miles", "13137": "$100 to $200 per month", "13138": "23% of the world\u2019s", "13139": "Niagara Falls International Airport", "13140": "A, B-6, C, E and K.", "13141": "$15-20,000 per parking", "13142": "7-10 days", "13143": "Oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS in short) is the metabolic pathway in which the mitochondria in cells use their structure, enzymes, and energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to reform ATP.

Mucous membranes are: - epithelial membranes that line body surfaces opening directly to the exterior, such as the lining of the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Membranes. Body membranes are thin sheets of tissue that cover the body, line body cavities, and cover organs within the cavities in hollow organs. They can be categorized into epithelial and connective tissue membrane. Mucous Membranes. Mucous membranes are epithelial membranes that consist of epithelial tissue that is attached to an underlying loose connective tissue. These membranes, sometimes called mucosae, line the body cavities that open to the outside. The urethra is also lined with a mucous membrane. Some mucous membranes are involved with digestion in the absorption of insoluble food molecules and secretion (releasing chemicals from glands). The thick fluid secreted by some mucous membranes and/or associated glands is termed mucus. Mucus prevents pathogens and dirt from entering the body and prevents bodily tissue from losing moisture. Mucous membranes are rather delicate; they are able to absorb a number of substances and toxins but are vulnerable regarding pain. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A mucous membrane or mucosa (plural, mucosae or mucosas; Latin tunica mucosa) is a lining of mostly endodermal origin. It consists of an epithelium (a layer, or layers of epithelial cells) and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue. Mucus prevents pathogens and dirt from entering the body and prevents bodily tissue from losing moisture. Mucous membranes are rather delicate; they are able to absorb a number of substances and toxins but are vulnerable regarding pain. Mucous membranes, also called mucosa, line the inside of cavities that open directly to the exterior environment. Mucous membranes line the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tracts and the urinary tract. This type of membrane is composed of an epithelial cell layer and an underlying connective tissue layer. The epithelial layer is an important defense mechanism that prevents the entry of pathogens and microbes into the body. The cells are tightly packed together, so fluid cannot leak through the epithelial layer. In vertebrates, mucus (/mju\u02d0k\u0259s/ MYOO-k\u0259ss; adjectival form : mucous) is a slippery secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. Mucous fluid is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands. Mucous cells secrete products that are rich in glycoproteins and water. The connective tissue component of a mucous membrane stabilizes the membrane against the structure it is protecting; it also holds blood vessels that supply blood and nutrients to the epithelial layer in place. This type of membrane is composed of an epithelial cell", "13190": "Electro Plated", "13192": "central London", "13193": "The definition of amplitude refers to the length and width of waves, such as sound waves, as they move or vibrate. How much a radio wave moves back and forth is an example of its amplitude. amplitude-Computer Definition. The extreme range, or magnitude, of a fluctuating value such as an acoustic or electromagnetic signal, amplitude is measured perpendicular to the to the time axis of a time-plot, i.e., frequency, of a sine wave. Regardless of the kind, every wave has an amplitude. Amplitude is the maximum displacement of points on a wave, which you can think of as the degree or intensity of change. This maximum displacement is measured from the equilibrium position. The picture below shows a diagram of a sine wave. Amplitude is an important parameter of waves and is the maximum displacement of points on a wave. Stated another way, amplitude is the vertical distance between a peak or a valley and the equilibrium point. Frequency is the number of wave cycles passing a point per unit time. The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. Peak-to-peak amplitude is the change between peak (highest amplitude value) and trough (lowest amplitude value, which can be negative). With appropriate circuitry, peak-to-peak amplitudes of electric oscillations can be measured by meters or by viewing the waveform on an oscilloscope The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave. Amplitude and period are important in the study of music and acoustics; amplitude indicates the energy, or loudness, of a sound and the period determines its pitch (pitch, or frequency, is the inverse of the period). Amplitude is the height from the mean, or rest, value of the function to its maximum or minimum. The period is the distance required for the function to complete one full cycle. For the sine function, the amplitude is given by and the period is defined as. The same is true for a cosine function Amplitude (noun). of extent of capacity or intellectual powers. Amplitude (noun). of extent of means or resources. Amplitude (noun). the arc of the horizon between the true east or west point and the center of the sun, or a star, at its rising or setting.

IP Tunneling and VPNs Overview The purpose of this module is to explain Virtual Private Network (VPN) concepts and to overview various L2 and L3 tunneling techniques that allow for implementation of VPNs. The access VPN features in Cisco IOS Release 12.1 are explained along with Layer 2 and Layer 3 tunneling mechanisms. Usually, Layer-3 tunneling is used either to connect two discontiguous parts of a non-IP network over an IP network, or to connect two IP networks over a backbone IP network, possibly hiding IP addressing details of the two networks from the backbone IP network. In IP tunnelling, every IP packet, including addressing information of its source and destination IP networks, is encapsulated within another packet format native to the transit network. Other variants of the IP-in-IP variety are IPv6-in-IPv4 (6in4) and IPv4-in-IPv6 (4in6). IP tunneling often bypasses simple firewall rules transparently since the specific nature and addressing of the original datagrams are hidden. Content-control software is usually required to block IP tunnels With IP-in-IP tunneling, an IP datagram is encapsulated with another IP header addressed to and from the endpoints of the IP-in-IP tunnel, as shown in Figure 4.5. An IP-in-IP tunnel is indicated by setting the IP Protocol field to 4 in the outer IP header. For more detailed information about IP-in-IP tunneling, see RFC 1853. A typical use for IP-in-IP tunnels is the forwarding of IP multicast traffic from one area of the intranet to another area of the intranet, across a portion of the intranet that does not support multicast forwarding or routing. Tunneling is the process in which one layer is encapsulated in the payload of another layer. In the OSI model. IP Tunneling: Suppose you tunnel an ip packet inside another ip packet. On the left you can see the packet to be encapsulated and on the right this packet is added as payload to another IP packet. On the receiving end the process is reversed and the payload packet is sent to the higher layers of stack. IP tunneling can be of many types ip over ip, ip6 over ip, ip over ip6. In TCP tunneling the same process is done at TCP level. TCP tunneling is generally used for port forwarding because traffic can be selectively forwarded based on destination port.

Age Group 26 to 75 Event Demographics Events Available for Sponsorship in 2008 First Ladies of Dream Foundation Luncheon & Fashion Show Photos from the 2007 First Ladies of Dream Foundation Luncheon and Fashion Show: 1. One of the most desired benefits that all sponsors hope to secure with their sponsorship is category exclusivity, and community event organizers such as Y-ME certainly understands that request. However, it is usually tied to the higher levels of sponsorship, and that\u2019s also the case with the Y-ME Walk to Empower events. Event sponsorship at the Y-ME walks breaks down as follows: Common Benefits Included in Sponsorships. 1 Logo inclusion on event marketing materials. 2 Right to use event logos. Best practice is to budget at least 10% of the gross value of the sponsorship \u2013 including any in-kind \u2013 for servicing. For this exercise, put your starting cost of servicing at 10% of the cost to deliver benefits plus the cost of sale, as it will grow appropriately as you multiply your baseline fee. There is no formula, but there is a methodology, and here are the basics\u2026. First, calculate your baseline fee. This is NOT what you\u2019d charge for a sponsorship, but the keep-your-arse-out-of-a-sling number \u2013 the number that keeps you from selling too low for it to be worth it. It's a good idea to have a wide range of levels so that smaller businesses as well as larger companies can find a level that suits their needs and budget. If your event is quite small, your entry-level sponsors might simply receive a small ad in an accompanying program or flyer for $50. For larger events, sponsor levels might begin at $200, $500 or even $1,000. Depending on audience size and publicity opportunities, cost of a title sponsorship could range from $750 to $10,000. Title sponsors receive maximum publicity, and their logo should appear in ALL publicity material. You should base your sponsor levels on the benefits to the company. This will give you an idea as to the cost of a sponsorship at each level. Know in advance that you may have to be flexible and customize levels for some sponsors to meet their marketing needs. Some sponsors might be interested in a half cash, half in-kind (product donation) sponsorship. FEES: Most charge 5%-10%. More than half of fiscal sponsors say they charge a flat fee, and 42% of the total are in the 5%-10% range. Also, of those with sliding-scale fees, almost two-thirds charge 5%-10%, usually depending on a project\u2019s revenues. 1 The 234 sponsors in the directory have completed a 10-question survey asking about their experience, eligibility requirements, fee structure, services and philosophy \u2014 enough information that prospective projects can get a feel for which sponsors might make a good fit for them. Marketers of consumer products may also engage in joint promotions with retailers, such as coupons and tie-ins. The fees involved in event marketing can range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the scale of the event and the level of the sponsor's involvement.", "13242": "A savanna is a rolling grassland scattered with shrubs and isolated trees, which can be found between a tropical rainforest and desert biome.", "13243": "Net income is calculated by taking revenues and adjusting for the cost of doing business, depreciation, interest, taxes and other expenses.", "13244": "Vegetables, legumes, and fruit were the mainstay, and fish was a favorite.", "13247": "producing many symphonies, concertos, piano sonatas, violin sonatas, an opera, masses and several overtures.", "13248": "Gastroileal reflex is one of the ways in which gastric motility influences intestinal motility.", "13249": "limestone, chalk, sandstone, conglomerate and shale.", "13250": "three-chambered hearts (except for alligators and crocodiles, which have four-chambered hearts).", "13251": "According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, fresh uncooked sausage can be kept in the refrigerator only one to two days although it can be kept in the freezer for one to two months.", "13252": "An ionic lattice is a structure of millions of atomic formations of an ionic substance, structured like building blocks into one three-dimensional formation.", "13253": "", "13254": "In Kundalini Gnanam Jeeva Samadhi is a person imbued with eternal life force.", "13255": "Susan Boyle pips Barack Obama", "13256": "Sweet Alyssum: Sweet alyssum flowers form a striking border massed together as bedding plants.", "13257": "1 Take out the SIM card and then put it back in. 2 If the SIM card is damaged, or doesn't fit in the SIM tray, contact your carrier. 3 If you have another device, see if you can connect your carrier's network with it in that location. 4 Contact your carrier to: 5 Verify that your account is active and in good standing.", "13258": "A guidance document is a publication, often by a regulatory agency, that contains a set of instructions, often to establish the publisher's expectations.", "13260": "undergraduate degree program, usually in a science area such as biology or chemistry.

One of the reasons that your skin\u2019s getting drier by the day could be due to the usage of harsh soaps or detergents. Washing clothes, utensils with them takes out the moisture from your skin and makes it very dry. Also, if you have dry skin and you wash your hands or face too many times with face wash/liquid soaps, it can further irritate the skin and make it itch. Tip: Wear gloves while washing pots and pans and use mild soaps to wash your face/hands. One mistake some people make is applying moisturiser on dry skin, when it's least likely to help. Put on moisturiser when your skin is still damp. That way, the moisturiser is trapping the moisture still on your skin. Your skin shouldn't be sopping wet -- just pat yourself dry with a towel and put it on. Let it soak in for a few minutes, and then towel off the excess. You've also got to get the right type of moisturiser. The moisturiser must also be thick and greasy in order to seal in the moisture needed for good dry skin care. One simple moisturiser test is to put some of your lotion in the palm of your hand and flip your hand over. If it runs or drips, it's not thick enough for dry skin. The skin on your face is especially sensitive, so it can dry out quicker than the rest of your skin.

The DNA contains the master plan for the creation of the proteins and other molecules and systems of the cell, but the carrying out of the plan involves transfer of the relevant information to RNA in a process called transcription. The RNA to which the information is transcribed is messenger RNA (mRNA). The process associated with RNA polymerase is to unwind the DNA and build a strand of mRNA by placing on the growing mRNA molecule the base complementary to that on the template strand of the DNA.

Barbacoa was later adopted into the cuisine of the southwestern United States by way of Texas, which had formerly been a part of northern Mexico. The word transformed in time to barbecue, as well as many other words related to ranching and Tex-Mex cowboy or vaquero life. In the United States, barbecue (also spelled barbeque or abbreviated BBQ) refers to a technique of cooking that involves cooking meat for long periods of time at low temperatures with smoke from a wood fire; often this is called pit barbecue, and the facility for cooking it is the barbecue pit. This form of cooking adds a distinctive smoky taste to the meat; barbecue sauce, while a common accompaniment, is not required for many styles.

Everything works toward developing a proper root system, so cater to that with regular watering. 3 Tips for Transplanting Conifers. According to some gardeners, autumn is the best time of year to plant conifers. So, for those of you who wish to take advantage of this Fall season, here are some tips on transplanting conifers: The size and condition of the root ball in relation to the overall size of the tree is a factor in the amount of stress a tree will realize when it is moved. It is important that a tree be moved to a receptive environment. Ambient air temperature, humidity, and wind velocity will affect water loss in the tree. We come to the root of the problem. The larger the root ball, the better the chance for success for the tree in its reestablishment. It is important to keep the integrity of the root ball intact to avoid transplant shock. A large portion of the food lifeline is being left behind. Make sure the tree or shrub is a manageable size. Shrubs up to three ft. tall and trees one in. or less in diameter (measured six in. above the soil level) can be moved without digging a solid root ball. These and most plants three to four years old may be moved as bare root transplants. It is also essential when transplanting mature plants. A tree or shrub to be transplanted in fall should be root pruned in the spring before new buds appear. Plants to be transplanted in spring should be root pruned the previous fall after the leaves drop. For this reason a large palm tree can be transplanted with a small root ball.

Respiratory acidosis involves a decrease in respiratory rate and/or volume (hypoventilation). Common causes include impaired respiratory drive (eg, due to toxins, CNS disease), and airflow obstruction (eg, due to asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, airway edema).

A crankshaft \u2014related to crank \u2014is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. The distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston stroke measurement, and thus engine displacement. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as shaft-stroking.. Top 10 amazing movie makeup transformations. The crankshaft is located in the engine of a vehicle and converts the force created by the engine's pistons moving up and down into a force that moves the wheels in a circular motion so the car can go forward. Located inside the car's engine, it is connected to all the pistons in the engine and to the flywheel. The pistons, which are attached to the crankshaft in an engine, are moved down by the explosions inside the cylinders. When the pistons move down, the crankshaft rotates. The pistons are connected to the crankshaft to ensure it moves with them and keeps their movements regulated. Many crankshaft position sensors are a type of electronic sensor known as a Hall effect sensor. A Hall effect sensor produces electricity in when it is exposed to a magnetic field. In a crankshaft position sensor, a toothed wheel, spinning with the crankshaft, disrupts the magnetic field. Sometimes it may be mounted at the rear or the side of the engine. Sometimes the crankshaft position sensor measures the speed of the clutch flywheel to determine the speed of the crankshaft. In these cases, the sensor is mounted to the bell housing of the transmission. Typical inductive crankshaft position sensor. A crank sensor is an electronic device used in an internal combustion engine to monitor the position or rotational speed of the crankshaft.

Geography is a synoptic science that uses the same elements as the other sciences but in a different context. It integrates data spatially, making elaborate use of maps as its special tool. In the study of geography two main branches may be distinguished, physical geography and human (or cultural) geography, originally anthropogeography. The first, based on the physical sciences, studies the world's surface, the distribution, delineation, and nature of its land and water areas. 1 Cultural geographers examine the relationship between geography and culture, studying how features such as religion, language, or ethnicity relate to location. 2 Economic geographers study economic activities and the distribution of resources. 1 Economic geographers study economic activities and the distribution of resources. 2 They may research subjects such as regional employment or the location of industries. 3 Environmental geographers research the impact humans have on the environment and how human activities affect natural processes. What Geographers Do. Geographers work in many different areas, such as environmental management, education, disaster response, city and county planning, community development, and more! Geography is an interdisciplinary field that offers diverse career opportunities. Geography is the science of place and space. Geographers ask where things are located on the surface of the earth, why they are located where they are, how places differ from one another, and how people interact with the environment. Geography is unique in linking the social sciences and natural sciences together. There are two main branches of geography: human geography and physical geography. Human geography is concerned with the spatial aspects of human existence. Physical geographers study patterns of climates, landforms, vegetation, soils, and water.

Among New World societies trepanning is most commonly found in the Andean civilizations such as the pre-Incan cultures, for example the Paracas culture Ica situated in what now is Ica located South of Lima. It has also been found in the Muisca Confederation (in modern-day Colombia) and the Inca Empire. There is some contemporary use of the term. In modern eye surgery, a trephine instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. During the Greek age, Hippocrates taught trepanning. There is evidence that trepanation was used as a cure for migraines. Trepanning is a type of surgery that involves drilling a small hole into the skull.

Although they may be scary for leaves, aquatic fungi are looked upon pretty favorably by the other stream dwellers. And this, for a leaf, must be a very frightening prospect. A daunting collection of leaf-eating fungi lurks in the waters of freshwater streams. A few are basidiomycetes or oomycetes, but most are ascomycetes and their asexual stages. These fungi are aquatic ascomycetes. Penetrating their substrates, aquatic ascomycetes release enzymes that break down the ligno-cellulose of plant cell walls, the pectins that hold cells together, and starch stored in plant tissues. The fungi then use the resulting simple sugars and amino acids to grow. The fungi are readily trapped from bodies of water, soil, or from surfaces where a water film forms transiently. The importance of chytrids in aquatic habitats is only now becoming clear. Chytrid DNA is closely associated with processes of removal of picoplankton in lakes and large water bodies. Conditions in fresh water are markedly different to those in the ocean. The open sea has quite different salinity to salterns where the water is slowly evaporating. Sometimes the water is extremely acidic or toxic. Fungi are found in all these environments. Mycomycota is the name for the fungi in lichens. Lichens are composed of fungus and algae in a symbiotic relationship, as the algae provides nutrients, while the fungus protects it from the elements. Lichens photosynthesize light, with photoautotrauphs located near the surface of the fungi. They are crucial decomposers, feeding on living and decaying organisms. They live in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments (even damp soil), in both salt and freshwater bodies of water. They are distinguished by their flagellated spores or gametes, which help the reproductive units repel through water. Aero-Aquatic Hyphomycetes: Ingoldian fungi are not the only fungal inhabitants of litter. Another group form large coiled or rounded conidia which trap air, and these are known as aero-aquatic hyphomycetes. The advantage of their spores is that when the water dries, spores can lodge in the mud. Conditions in fresh water are markedly different to those in the ocean. The open sea has quite different salinity to salterns where the water is slowly evaporating. Sometimes the water is extremely acidic or toxic. Fungi are found in all these environments. Other fungi grow with algae and cyanobacteria forming lichens. Fungi can be detrimental in that some fungi cause plant diseases that cause the loss of economically important crops. (For more on plant fungal diseases, click here.) Fungi can also cause animal (humans included) diseases. Classically, the following groups have been considered fungi: 1) slime molds have a feeding phase of the life cycle (the trophic phase) that are motile and lack cell walls. Food particles are ingested. 2) aquatic fungi have cell walls and absorb nutrients rather than ingest them. The sex cells and spores of aquatic fungi are motile (zoospores). Oomycetes (water molds) Chytridiomycetes (unicellular chytrids). 3) terrestrial fungi have cell walls and absorb nutrients rather than ingest them. The sex cells and spores are not motile (zoospores). Zygomycetes (e.g. black bread mold, animal dung fungi) Ascomycetes (e.g. cup fungi, truffles) Basidiomycetes (e.g. mushrooms or toadstools, puff balls, rusts, smuts) Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular fungus, is used to make bread and other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. 1 With plants: Fungi have a cell wall and vacuoles. 2 They reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as ferns and mosses) produce spores. 3 Similar to mosses and algae, fungi typically have haploid nuclei. However, it is often unclear whether such fungi,lacking typical morphological adaptations, are terres-trial or truly aquatic.

The clavicle (collarbone) is found on the front of the shoulder and connects the arm to the body by a joint at the sternum, or breast bone (the sterno-clavicular joint), and by a joint at the scapula, or shoulder blade (the acromio-clavicular joint). If you break your clavicle (collarbone), you will experience pain in the area of the break. You may see purple bruising in the area that may spread to the shoulder and arm. Swelling will occur at the injury site, and in the arm. You may see a bump in the area of the break from the bone lifting the skin, like a tent. A broken collarbone is usually pretty obvious. You might feel a crack when it happens. Afterward, you will probably have: 1 Pain and swelling. 2 Difficulty moving your arm and shoulder. 3 A grinding feeling when you try to raise your arm. 4 Sagging in your shoulder. 5 A bump around the area of the break. It might take six to 12 weeks for a broken collarbone to heal. But that's just a rough estimate. People recover at different speeds.

The average labor cost to install a bathroom sink faucet runs between $140 to $200 to replace.

It would take about 1 to 2 hours to remove the old faucet and replace it with a new one if the water shutoff valves are in good condition.

Most plumbers have a minimum charge that involves a call out fee and a minimum amount of time. In my area, the minimum is around $85 and that includes the first hour of time. Parts are extra. If it isn't an emergency, you can sometimes negotiate a smaller fee with less control on when they show up.

Urea (NH2)2CO is a chemical that comes from the breakdown of proteins. It is the main source of Nitrogen in urine and is excreted by the body as a waste product from your kidn \u2026 eys. Urea is a readily available source of Nitrogen so is used as a fertilizer and sometimes as a supplement to feed for stock. . 60 people found this useful. Full Definition of EXCRETION. 1. : the act or process of excreting. 2. : something excreted; especially: metabolic waste products (as urea and carbon dioxide) that are eliminated from the body. See excretion defined for English-language learners. See excretion defined for kids. ADVERTISEMENT. Urea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the urea cycle, either from the oxidation of amino acids or from ammonia. In this cycle, amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea, while L-ornithine, citrulline, L-argininosuccinate, and L-arginine act as intermediates. Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals, and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine of mammals. It is colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic (LD50 is 15 g/kg for rats). Metabolism is chemical reactions taking place inside cells, including respiration. The body excretes three main waste materials. These are Carbon Dioxide, Urea and Water. Excretion is a very important feature to us because without it toxic substances will build up in our bodies and kill us. It also helps in maintaining the composition of body fluids. Urea: Chemical compound of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen produced as waste by cells that break down protein. Ureter: Tube that carries urine from a kidney to the urinary bladder. Urethra: Duct leading from the urinary bladder to outside the body through which urine is eliminated. The kidneys, considered the main excretory organs in humans, eliminate water, urea, and other waste products from the body in the form of urine. Other systems and organs in the body also play a part in excretion. The Urea Cycle. About 80% of the excreted waste nitrogen is in the form of urea which is produced exclusively in the liver, in a series of reactions that are distributed between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. The series of reactions that form urea is known as the Urea Cycle or the Krebs-Henseleit Cycle. The excretory system is a system of organs that removes waste products from the body. When cells in the body break down proteins (large molecules that are essential to the structure and functioning of all living cells), they produce wastes such as urea (a chemical compound of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen). The kidneys, considered the main excretory organs in humans, eliminate water, urea, and other waste products from the body in the form of urine. Other systems and organs in the body also play a part in excretion. Excretion and the liver Excretion in mammals Excretion is the removal of potentially harmful or toxic substances from the body. These substances are usually waste materials produced by complex chemical reactions taking place in living cells. Enzymes catalyse the reactions. The urea and water are released from the liver cells to the bloodstream and transported to the kidneys where the blood is filtered and the urea is passed out of the body in the urine.", "14092": "20 and 30 days before they start to charge interest.

Pay when you receive the statement. Yes you will be charged interest, but this is what you need to do in order to build your credit rating.

Making the world better, one answer at a time. The age limit for elderly life insurance will depend on the life insurance carrier with whom you are applying for coverage.

You may only purchase life insurance up to age 85, which is the age at which life insurance companies no longer sell life insurance to individuals. At age 85, you are considered uninsurable. However, you may keep a life insurance policy in force that is already purchased. Term life insurance is life insurance that is temporary, which means that the policy renews either every year or after a set number of years. Permanent life insurance is the other type of life insurance. This type of insurance does not renew. Term life insurance policies remain in force until the term expires, and permanent policies cover the insured to death, regardless of age. However, the maximum age at which life insurance policies are issued depends on the issuing company. In general, very few companies will issue a policy past age 85, and some set their maximum age at issue to age 80 or 75. There are several different types of life insurance available to seniors who have not reached that maximum age, some of which remain in force until death. When you purchase level term life, you generally choose between a 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, 20-year or 30-year term policy. Life insurance companies do not insure you beyond age 85 with a term policy, so the maximum age at which you may be able to renew your policy depends on the policy you have purchased. Annual Renewable Term. Annual renewable term life is life insurance that renews every year. This type of life insurance automatically renews up to age 85. Beyond this age, you will not qualify for any type of life insurance and your term policy will be canceled. The maximum age will also depend on the type of plan you are looking for. For instance a 10 year term life insurance policy can be bought by individuals under the age of 80. If you are over 80 then you will most likely have to buy a permanent life insurance policy, such as a whole or universal life.

There are many types of water pumps, but there is no ideal pump for every occasion. Water pumps are used mainly for dewatering purpose to reduce downtime from large rain events. Water pumps should be evaluated based on performance, low downtime, durability and price. Refer to the table below for information about the types of well pumps available. Utility pumps are a broad classification of pumps available in a variety of configurations and used for short-term or emergency use to move liquids, often water, from one place to another. Refer to the table below for the most common utility pump types and functions they provide. There are three types of centrifugal pumps\u2014radial, mixed, and axial flow pumps. In the radial pumps, pressure is developed completely through a centrifugal force, while in axial pumps pressure is developed by lift generated by the impeller. Mixed flow pumps develop flow through a centrifugal force and the impeller. 37 While pumps typically operate to serve various chemical process support equipments such as chillers, cooling towers, material transfer, etc., pumping is considered an individual process separate from the processes of the aforementioned equipment. A pump is a device used to raise, compress, or transfer fluids. Radial centrifugal pumps are centrifugal pumps that completely use centrifugal force to develop pressure. Mixed centrifugal pumps are centrifugal pumps that use both centrifugal force and the action of the impeller on the liquid to develop pressure. Centrifugal pumps can use many sources for a power supply, including AC power, DC power, natural gas, steam, water, gasoline, and solar power. Some centrifugal pumps, when purchased, do not include a power source. More about Centrifugal Pumps. Click here to find Centrifugal Pumps Manufacturers. There are three general categories that centrifugal pumps fall into: mixed flow, axial flow, and radial flow.

Sinus infection (sinusitis) occurs when the sinuses and nasal passages are infected or inflamed. Most sinus infections are caused by a virus. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the sinus infection is likely to be caused by bacteria. Why It Is Used. Antibiotics often clear up a bacterial ear infection. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic often chosen for treating ear infections. It works well and costs less than other brands. Doctors sometimes prescribe antibiotics to prevent infections in children who are prone to repeated ear infections (recurrent otitis media). But experts disagree on how helpful this is. How Well It Works. Antibiotics are effective in most cases of ear infections caused by bacteria. But only 1 out of 5 children with ear infections needs antibiotics to clear an ear infection. In 4 out of 5 children, ear infections clear on their own. A child with an ear infection should feel better within 48 hours after taking antibiotic When doctors do prescribe antibiotics, they most often use amoxicillin, because it works well and costs less than other brands. When your child takes antibiotics for an ear infection, it is very important to take all of the medicine as directed, even if your child feels better. 1 Mild side effects, such as diarrhea and rash, from taking antibiotics are common. 2 Severe side effects are rare. 3 Cost. 4 Most antibiotics are expensive. 5 You may want to weigh the cost against the fact that most ear infections clear up without treatment. In some cases, the infection may also involve the outer ear. Otitis externa caused by excessive exposure to moisture is commonly called swimmer's ear.

Antibiotics are prescribed for some types of bacterial ear infections in adults. Since different types of ear infections require different treatment, your doctor will do a careful examination and obtain your health history before deciding how best to treat your ear infection.

The Lend-Lease Act was passed on March 11, 1941. Lend-Lease was a program of the United States Federal government during World War II which enabled the United States to provide the Allied nations with war material while the US was still officially a neutral country. What is the definition for Lend-lease Act? It was the name of the program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, France and other Allied nations with vast amounts \u2026 of war materiel between 1941 and 1945 in return for, in the case of Britain, military bases. The Lend-Lease Act was passed by Congress on March 11, 1941. It provided that the president could ship weapons, food, or equipment to any country whose struggle against the Axis assisted U.S. defense. By retooling U.S. industrial output to the demands of war, Lend-Lease formally eliminated any semblance of neutrality. Early in World War II the United States devised a plan, dubbed Lend-Lease, to assist the nations that were then fighting the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy). Through the Lend Lease Act, Britain received over $31 billion from the U.S. Other countries received a total of $19 billion. The money allowed Britain to continue fighting against the Axis Powers until the attack on Pearl Harbor caused the U.S. to also join the War. What is the definition for Lend-lease Act?

Lend-Lease Act. On 11th March 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act. The legislation gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the powers to sell, transfer, exchange, lend equipment to any country to help it defend itself against the Axis powers. A sum of $50 billion was appropriated by Congress for Lend-Lease To ease Britain's shortage of war materials, Roosevelt pushed for the creation of the Lend-Lease Program. Officially titled An Act Further to Promote the Defense of the United States, the Lend-Lease Act was signed into law on March 11, 1941. A critical program for winning the war, Lend-Lease came to an abrupt end with its conclusion. As Britain needed to retain much of the Lend-Lease equipment for postwar use, the Anglo-American Loan was signed through which the British agreed to purchase the items for approximately ten cents on the dollar. Although the Lend-Lease Act was enacted to provide aid to China and the British Empire, eligibility under its provisions was expanded to include all Allies who were essential to the maintenance of the security of the United States. In exchange for the valuable assistance provided under the Lend-Lease Act (55 Stat. 31 [1941]), the Allies were to comply with the terms set by the president for repayment. lend\u2032-lease\u2032. 1. the materiel mat\u00e9riel and services supplied by The.U. s to its allies During World WAR ii under an act Of (Congress\u2032-Lend\u2032 Lease`) act passed in. 1941. 2 the system by which such aid was. supplied. 3 to (supply materiel mat\u00e9riel) or services by-the lend. lease system The Lend-Lease Act of March 11, 1941, was the principal means for providing U.S. military aid to foreign nations during World War II.", "14565": "1 Insert the installation disc in the CD or DVD drive on your computer. 2 On the setup screen, click Install. 3 The Xbox 360 Accessories setup program installs the necessary files to your computer.", "14566": "Radiolaria are holoplanktonic protozoa and form part of the zooplankton, they are non-motile (except when flagella-bearing reproductive swarmers are produced) but contain buoyancy enhancing structures; they may be solitary or colonial.", "14567": "79-82 degrees.

An exostectomy to remove the bunion is usually performed prior to the osteotomy to treat the foot deformity. Individuals with bunions on their feet may experience extreme pain while wearing high heels. Mild toe deformity is often treated with a procedure called a chevron metatarsal osteotomy. In this procedure, the metatarsal cut is made at the end of the bone closest to the tip of the toe, which is sufficient when the degree of toe bending is small. The term Osteotomy, in practice, refers to reshaping a bone. When the pelvic side of the socket is repaired, it is called \u201cpelvic osteotomy\u201d.

An osteotomy is an elective surgical procedure, performed under general anesthesia, in which a bone is cut or a portion is taken out in order to fix a bad bone alignment, to shorten or lengthen the bone, or to correct damage due to osteoarthritis. With a knee osteotomy, the bone is cut in order to shift the weight to the good side of the joint. This stabilizes the knee and reduces the pain of putting weight on worn cartilage. This type of procedure is good for young, active patients who will likely outlive the lifespan of a knee replacement. Osteotomy of the Knee. Osteotomy literally means cutting of the bone.. In a knee osteotomy, either the tibia (shinbone) or femur (thighbone) is cut and then reshaped to relieve pressure on the knee joint. Knee osteotomy is used when you have early-stage osteoarthritis that has damaged just one side of the knee joint. Knee osteotomy is a surgical procedure that may be recommended if you have arthritis damage in just one area of your knee. The procedure involves removing or adding a wedge of bone to your upper shinbone (tibia) or lower thighbone (femur) to help shift your body weight off the damaged portion of your knee joint.

Storage form of carbohydrate in plants, plants use for energy Mainly in seeds, roots, and tubers-similar in structure to glycogen but fewer branches-potatoes and grains are major sources of starch. Some glucose is used to form the more complex carbohydrate cellulose, the main structural component of plant cell walls. Some is used to provide immediate energy to plant cells. The rest is changed to a different chemical form, usually starch, and stored in seeds, roots, or fruits for later use. Glycogen is the form in which glucose is stored in the liver and muscles of animals for energy needs. Muscle glycogen is used primarily to fuel muscle contractions (such as during exercise). Liver glycogen is used to restore glucose to the blood when the sugar level is low (such as between meals). The body stores carbohydrate in the muscles and the liver. The total store of carbohydrate is 500g. 400g in the muscle and 100g in the liver.

If you happen to earn over the IRS limits, you can still contribute to an IRA, but you will not be entitled to an IRA contribution deduction on your tax return. This is known as a non-deductible IRA contribution, which requires you to file Form 8606 with your tax return listing the contribution as such. Deductible vs. nondeductible IRA contributions. In 2013, the maximum you can contribute to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs is the lesser of (a) $5,500 or (b) your taxable compensation for the year. If you're 50 or older, the limit is $6,500. You can make contributions to a traditional IRA until age 70-1/2. However, your pre-existing (non-Roth) IRA funds in Traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs will likely all be deductible contributions and their pre-tax earnings. When you make a Roth conversion, you cannot limit your conversion to just your nondeductible contribution. A Backdoor Roth IRA is a technique for contributing to a Roth IRA when your income exceeds the contribution limit. There is no income limit on contributing to a nondeductible Traditional IRA, nor on converting a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. In both Roth IRA and non-deductible traditional IRA, contributions are non-deductible, meaning that you fund them with after-tax money. The major difference comes from the way earnings are taxed. Earnings are taxed as ordinary income if you withdraw them from a non-deductible traditional IRA. If you are, a Roth IRA is strictly better than a non-deductible traditional IRA because earnings are tax free in a Roth IRA. If you are not eligible for a Roth IRA, then the answer is somewhat complicated. See other questions on this page for details. Although not as exciting as a deductible IRA, earnings from the non-deductible IRA remain sheltered from income taxes until withdrawn. Generally, deductible Traditional IRA contributions are limited if you or your spouse is covered by an employer provided retirement plan. Meanwhile, Roth IRA contributions are limited as well. These contribution limitations for these IRA\u2019s are based on your modified adjusted gross income. 1 For some people who want to invest in a Roth but can\u2019t because of the income limitations, the non-deductible IRA offers a back door strategy. 2 In 2010, the rules where lifted and now anyone regardless of income can now convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Instructions. Request a conversion from your traditional IRA containing non-deductible contributions to your Roth IRA by completing the Roth IRA conversion form available from your financial institution. Once you have submitted the form, the financial institution will automatically transfer the money Comparing the Roth IRA with a traditional nondeductible IRA. You can contribute to an IRA even if you're covered by a retirement plan sponsored by your employer. But in this case your deduction may be reduced or eliminated, depending on your income level. If you're choosing between a Roth IRA and a nondeductible contribution to a regular IRA, the Roth IRA can be a clear winner. Here's the choice: 1 Contribute to a regular IRA. 2 Get no deduction when your money goes in. The IRA consists of $90,000 in non-deductible contributions and $10,000 in earnings. If she decides to convert the entire IRA to Roth, she would only have to pay tax on the earnings portion ($10,000). At a 30% tax rate, she would owe $3,000 in tax to convert the entire $100,000 to Roth. If Smith had no earnings in this IRA, the entire $100,000 (all non-deductible contributions) could be converted with no tax liability.

It flows continuously through the ventricles of the brain and over the surface of the brain and spinal cord.

A bullet's caliber is usually denoted as its diameter in hundredths of an inch (a .22- inch diameter bullet is .22 caliber). 1 In some cases it is customary to state the diameter directly in inches: a .410 gauge shotgun, more properly called .410 bore, has a bore diameter of 0.41 inch. 2 This measurement is really the caliber rather than a gauge. 0.526. Notes: 1 Gauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm, and is expressed as the multiplicative inverse of the sphere's weight as a fraction of a pound (e.g., a 1\u204412 th pound ball fits a 12-gauge bore). Thus there are twelve 12-gauge balls per pound (etc.). The fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter. The chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a forcing cone in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter. The centerbore of a wheel is the size of the machined hole on the back of the wheel that centers the wheel properly on the hub of the car.

They had different side effect profiles, depending on their binding at sites for other classes of receptors (Table 1). The latter 2 drugs are associated with the most side effects and the highest discontinuation rates because of side effects in clinical trials. During long-term SSRI therapy, the most troubling adverse effects are sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sleep disturbance. Table 2 Although some SSRI-associated adverse effects can be intolerable or troubling, except for the serotonin syndrome, they are not life-threatening. As with other classes of antidepressants, SSRIs induce side effects that can be predicted by receptor physiology. Through the broad-based experience with the SSRIs, the frequency of side effects such as sexual dysfunction and sleep disturbance has increased. The latter 2 drugs are associated with the most side effects and the highest discontinuation rates because of side effects in clinical trials. During long-term SSRI therapy, the most troubling adverse effects are sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sleep disturbance. Table 2 Highest rate of discontinuation symptoms (equal to paroxetine). Higher rates of stopping due to side effects than with SSRIs. See the individual antidepressant medicine page for more side effects of antidepressants included in the Table, and for side effects of antidepressants not included. Follow the links in the Antidepressants A \u2013 Z list to the individual antidepressant pages. Talk to your doctor about which side effects are more important for you to avoid. Keep in mind that insomnia, headaches and nausea will often get better with time, but other side effects (e.g. sexual dysfunction) may not. 1 Possible side effects. 2 Side effects of antidepressants vary from one medication to another and from person to person. 3 Bothersome side effects, such as dry mouth, weight gain or sexual side effects, can make it difficult to stick with treatment. 4 Whether it worked for a close relative. 1 These medications are safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. 2 SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).", "14831": "$12,000 to", "14832": "The agonist-antagonist opioid analgesics are a heterogeneous group of drugs with moderate to strong analgesic activity comparable to that of the pure agonist opioids such as codeine and morphine but with a limited effective dose range.", "14833": "minimum cost per square foot of a concrete slab is $1.36 and the maximum is $1.88.", "14834": "the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core.", "14835": "A locking, or floating, floor is an engineered floor, but with the added advantage of a locking tongue-and-groove system.", "14836": "a more stable complex with solutions which contain cyclodextrin towards hydrolytic degradations.", "14837": "burst of electromagnetic radiation that results from an explosion (usually from the detonation of a nuclear weapon) and/or a solar flare.", "14838": "A specialized structure or junction that allows cell to cell communication.", "14839": "to control pests on nearby farms.", "14840": "seventh dimensional frequency healing and ascension process that is advanced, multidimensional, works with the lightbody and creates alchemy.", "14841": "If you could invent a green-cleaning wonder product, it would probably end up being a lot like white vinegar.", "14842": "type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder.", "14844": "$50 and $150 per signing when notarizing documents like Jurats and Acknowledgements.", "14845": "$6-$16 a square foot", "14846": "The 5 food groups consist of Grains, Fruits and Vegetables, Dairy, Meat and Protein, Fats Oils and Sweets.", "14847": "routes were global trade routes that shaped and impacted their respective areas during the Iron Age.

A square 10 acres is 660 by 660 feet. A more commonly found 10 acre plot is 330 by 1320 square feet with the 330 feet being the road frontage. This is due to how land was divided by the Public Land Survey System/US Geological Survey. The Answer: Because an acre is a measure of area, not length, it is defined in square feet. An acre can be of any shape\u2014a rectangle, a triangle, a circle, or even a star\u2014so long as its area is exactly 43,560 square feet. The most standard shape for an acre is one furlong by one chain, or 660 feet by 66 feet. A square-shaped acre would then be about 208.7 by 208.7 feet (because 208.7 x 208.7 = ~43,560). An acre 100 feet wide would be 435.6 feet long (100 x 435.6 = 43,560) and an acre 1 foot wide would be 43,560 feet long. To find the linear measurements of other rectangular acres, just divide 43,560 by the number of feet you want on one side. A square-shaped acre would then be about 208.7 by 208.7 feet (because 208.7 x 208.7 = ~43,560). An acre 100 feet wide would be 435.6 feet long (100 x 435.6 = 43,560) and an acre 1 foot wide would be 43,560 feet long. It is purely an area of 43,560 square feet. The two sides of a 1-acre rectangular lot can be any lengths as long as multiplying one by the other gives 43,560 (if they are measured in feet). For example, imagine a sidewalk 5 feet wide. If it were (43560 \u00f7 5 =) 8712 feet long it would take up an acre, a long skinny acre. On the other hand, if the 1-acre lot were a square, its sides would be only 208.7 feet. Because the acre is a measure of area, it has no specific perimeter. For example, using the examples in question one, the perimeter of the long, skinny sidewalk acre would be 17,434 feet (more than 3 miles), but the perimeter of the square acre would be 835 feet. One acre is 4,840 square yards or 43,560 square feet, and so a square piece of land measuring 208.71032 feet on all four sides is approximately an acre. The number of sets of dimensions that will equal an acre is infinite. For instance, a piece of land 10 feet wide and 4,356 feet long is exactly one acre because 10 x 4,356 = 43,560. Moreover, a piece of land 30 feet wide and 1,452 feet long is an acre because the two dimensions equal 43,560 square feet when multiplied. One acre is about 4,046.873 square meters.", "14860": "Velour is a fabric which is somewhat similar to velvet. It has thick and soft nap which gives it a luxurious touch.

A series of laws known collectively as the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed by the Federalist Congress in 1798 and signed into law by President Adams. These laws included new powers to deport foreigners as well as making it harder for new immigrants to vote The Federalists believed that Democratic-Republican criticism of Federalist policies was disloyal and feared that aliens living in the United States would sympathize with the French during a war. As a result, a Federalist-controlled Congress passed four laws, known collectively as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These laws raised the residency requirements for citizenship from 5 to 14 years, authorized the President to deport aliens, and permitted their arrest, imprisonment, and deportation during wartime.

This phenomenon can be explained by the endosymbiont hypothesis of the origin of mitochondria as prokaryotes internalized by a eukaryotic host cell. The folds in the inner membrane of the mitochondria are called cristae. They serve to provide a greater surface area for the proton-pump through which protons pass down their \u2026 concentration gradient through ATP synthase to produce ATP in cellular respiration. 1 person found this useful. Mitochondria are enclosed by a double-membrane system made up of an inner and an outer membrane. The space between these two membranes is called (surprise!) the intermembrane space. The inner membrane encloses the interior of the mitochondrion, which is known as the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane also forms a large number of folds, called cristae, that extend into the matrix. See Fig. The inner mitochondrial membrane is highly folded into structures called cristae, which significantly increase the surface area of the inner membrane. The narrow space between the inner membrane and the outer membranes is known as the intermembrane space. The outer membrane contains a large number of proteins that form pores or channels through the membrane allowing small molecules to pass freely between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm. Let's review. Mitochondrial cristae are folds of the mitochondrial inner membrane that provide an increase in the surface area. Having more cristae gives the mitochondrion more locations for ATP production to occur. Cristae are folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain and chemiosmosis takes place on this membrane as part of cellular respiration to create ATP and can be seen in the diagram: Best Answer: The inner membrane of the mitochondrion, the cristae is folded to increase the surface area. The cytochromes of the electron transport chain are located on stalked particles on the christae. The electron transport chain is the main energy (ATP) generating stage aerobic respiration. They are a separate part of the mitochondrion that are attached to the inner membrane. They are derived from the inner membrane, and are pinched off by characteristic protein complexes at the point where they meet the inner membrane (this is called a 'cristal junction'). Mitochondrial cristae are folds of the mitochondrial inner membrane that provide an increase in the surface area. This allows a greater space for processes that happen across this membrane. The electron transport chain and chemiosmosis are the processes which help produce ATP in the final steps of cellular respiration. Cristae are folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

It al depends on how you lift and what your diet is like. Guidelines on how many times to bench press weight varies by your age, health and fitness goals. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends eight to 12 repetitions for people younger than 50 who have reached puberty. The amount you can bench press increases in proportion to your body weight. Untrained lifters, for example, can generally bench about half their body weight -- 50 pounds for women weighing around 97 pounds, and 90 pounds for those weighing 198 pounds. So if you started on the bench press with 8 reps of 225 pounds, but can now do 10 reps, and you've been able to achieve 10 reps for two workouts in a row, increase the weight. 1 For upper-body exercises like the bench press, increase the weight by approximately 5 percent. If you weigh 165 pounds, for example, and are an intermediate lifter with around two years of experience, you can expect to hit the bench standard of 100 pounds if you are older than 40, 90 pounds if you are older than 50, and 65 pounds if you are in your 60s.

The pancreas is the main digestive gland in our body and it secretes these enzymes: Trypsin: a protease that cleaves proteins at the basic amino acids. Chymotrypsin: a \u2026 protease that cleaves proteins at the aromatic amino acids. Steapsin: which degrades triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. The pancreas and bile duct (biliary) systems together form an important part of the digestive system. The pancreas and liver produce juices (pancreatic juice and bile) which help in the process of digestion (i.e. the breakdown of foods into parts which can be absorbed easily and used by the body). The pancreas stores and secretes pancreatic juice into the duodenum to complete the chemical digestion of food that began in the mouth and stomach. Pancreatic juice contains a mixture of enzymes including amylases, proteases, lipases, and nucleases. When food enters the duodenum it is deluged with pancreatic juice, which is defined as an alkaline secretion of the pancreas containing enzymes that aid in the digestion of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. Three enzymes found in pancreatic juice, called trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase, are the pancreatic enzymes that complete the digestion of proteins. Because proteins are held together by peptide bonds, these enzymes work by breaking peptide bond The pancreas makes pancreatic juices and hormones.

An ongoing debate in academic circles over the past 50-odd years relates to the correlation between leadership and management. Leading vs Managing a Project. Project management involves the use of knowledge, techniques and skills to execute the projects more effectively and efficiently. Usually the projects are aligned with the goals of the business organizations. The leaders guide the project team by giving them strategic direction and setting the team goals. Employee\u2019s ideas are welcomed by the person leading a project as employees are facing the real time conditions. 1 Leadership and management must go hand in hand. 2 Workers need their managers not just to assign tasks but to define purpose. 3 Managers must organize workers, not just to maximize efficiency, but to nurture skills, develop talent and inspire results. But in the new economy, where value comes increasingly from the knowledge of people, and where workers are no longer undifferentiated cogs in an industrial machine, management and leadership are not easily separated. Leaders on the other hand do not have subordinates. They tend to have followers, and following is more of a voluntary activity than a forced one as in the case of subordinates. Leadership is a charismatic, transformational style. Leaders do not tell people what to do as this does not inspire them. Differences between Leadership and Management. \u2022 While the essence of leadership is change, that of management is stability. \u2022 While leadership focuses on leading people, management focuses on work management. \u2013 The manager is the classic good soldier; the leader is his or her own person. \u2013 The manager does things right; the leader does the right thing. Perhaps there was a time when the calling of the manager and that of the leader could be separated. But in the new economy, where value comes increasingly from the knowledge of people, and where workers are no longer undifferentiated cogs in an industrial machine, management and leadership are not easily Your main focus is not only to oversee them, you need to make sure all the duties and responsibilities of the department are carried out properly. For most small businesses, the manager has one of the most important responsibilities and that is to make sure the business runs smoothly on a day-to-day basis. You need to have a number of different skills in order to be a good manager. There is one thing that you must learn to understand and that is the difference between managing and leading. This article will discuss the difference between the two skills: Managing. Leadership and management must go hand in hand. They are not the same thing. But they are necessarily linked, and complementary. Any effort to separate the two is likely to cause more problems than it solves. Still, much ink has been spent delineating the differences. But in the new economy, where value comes increasingly from the knowledge of people, and where workers are no longer undifferentiated cogs in an industrial machine, management and leadership are not easily separated. Management style is transactional, in that the manager tells the subordinate what to do, and the subordinate does this not because they are a blind robot, but because they have been promised a reward (at minimum their salary) for doing so.

Meristems are the location of growth for plants including the root, base of roots, stems, flowers, and leaves. There are specific names for these types of meristems. For example, root (or shoot or floral) apical meristem and basal meristem. There are two major types of meristems: primary and secondary. Primary meristems are tissues that make the plant taller, or a plant's appendages (e.g. branches) grow longer A meristem is the tissue in most plants containing undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells), found in zones of the plant where growth can take place. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of the plant and keep the plant growing. These secondary meristems are also known as lateral meristems because they are involved in lateral growth. At the meristem summit, there is a small group of slowly dividing cells, which is commonly called the central zone. Cells in the meristem, however, divide and produce all of the new cells in a plant. While meristem tissue is the source of the regenerative potential of a plant, meristems also play a pivotal role in normal plant growth. Plants have the unique ability to continue to grow and develop new organs while functioning as a mature, reproducing organism. Both roots and shoots have meristematic tissue at their tips called apical meristems that are responsible for the lengthening of roots and shoots. The shoot apical meristem is formed during embryonic development, but after germination gives rise to the stem, leaves, and flowers. Apical meristem is found at the apices, or tips of the plant, both the tip of the shoot and the root and is a region of actively dividing cells. The definition of is easy to remember when you break it down. An apex (plural: apices) is the tip, the very end, of something. While some of the cells of the apical meristem divide to generate new meristematic cells, most of the offspring cells differentiate into specialized cell types that stop dividing and function as a part of the organ in which they were generated. Both roots and shoots have meristematic tissue at their tips called apical meristems that are responsible for the lengthening of roots and shoots. The shoot apical meristem is formed during embryonic development, but after germination gives rise to the stem, leaves, and flowers.

Cat lifespan varies from breed to breed; however, the average lifespan of a free-roaming cat is less than 3 years, whereas the lifespan of an indoor cat averages 15 to 18 years. Spayed and neutered cats live longer because they do not develop ovarian or testicular cancers.

A common misconception is that investors need to hold the stock through the record date or pay date. As an example, ABC Inc declares a $1 dividend with an ex-dividend date of January 10th. Anybody who buys the shares on the 7th, 8th, or 9th\u2014or any date prior to the 10th\u2014will get that dividend. For example, imagine shares in a company are trading at $50 and the company announces a dividend of $5. Investors who hold the shares past the ex-dividend date will receive the $5; investors who sell before the ex-date will not. But all is not lost: shares in the company will fall by roughly the amount of the dividend, to $45, or there will be an arbitrage opportunity in the market. If the investor were to sell the stock on the ex-dividend date or afterwards, the investor would still be entitled to the dividend payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the ex-dividend date, the investor would be a stockholder on the record date. If the investor sells the stock on the ex-dividend date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the record date given the three stock business trading day settlement.

Segregation is separation of humans into racial groups in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, riding on a bus, or in the rental or purchase of a home. Segregation itself is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. Attendance at high-poverty schools causes disadvantaged students' performance to decline (Rumberger, 2007). A review of studies evaluating court-ordered desegregation concluded that the circumstantial case linking school segregation to the test score gap is compelling (Vigdor & Ludwig, 2008, p. 208). Across the United States, low-income black children's isolation has increased. It's a problem not only of poverty but also of race. The share of black students attending schools that are more than 90 percent minority grew from 34 percent in 1989 to 39 percent in 2007. The reasons for resegregation are complicated. While mandating segregation is illegal, segregation in schools often results when neighborhoods are segregated. For example, if children in a poor, mostly black part of a city attend the closest school, the students in that school are likely to be mostly poor and black. The increasing segregation is often a reflection of the neighborhood, Reardon said. People want their children to attend schools that are in their neighborhood, that they can walk to, and that allow their children to meet friends who live nearby. In 2010, the Israeli supreme court sent a message against racial segregation in a case involving the Slonim Hassidic sect of the Ashkenazi Jews, ruling that segregation between Ashkenazi and Sephardi students in a school is illegal.

A fat-soluble vitamin or a mixture of vitamins, especially vitamin A 1 or a mixture of vitamins A 1 and A 2, occurring principally in fish-liver oils, milk, and some yellow and dark green vegetables, and functioning in normal cell growth and development. A vitamin important for normal vision, tissue growth, and healthy skin. It is found in fish-liver oils, milk, green leafy vegetables, and yellow vegetables and fruits. 1 Beta carotene is converted, as needed, to vitamin A. Food sources of beta carotene include vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach and other leafy green vegetables; and fruit such as cantaloupes and apricots. A form of vitamin A called retinal is responsible for transmitting light sensation in the retina of the eye. Deficiency of vitamin A leads to night blindness. The word vitamin was coined in 1911 by the Warsaw-born biochemist Casimir Funk (1884-1967). In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal.

For example, sucking from a nipple for food is different than using a straw. Use of the straw is not response to stimulus, and therefore not a reflex. Reflexes follow a Reflex ARC.

Tweet. : reflex inhibition of the emptying of the stomach's contents through the pylorus that occurs when the duodenum is stimulated by the presence of irritants, is overloaded, or is obstructed. The enterogastric reflex is one of the three extrinsic reflexes of the gastrointestinal tract, the other two being the gastrocolic reflex and the gastroileal reflex. The enterogastric reflex is stimulated in the duodenum by a pH of 3-4 and in the stomach by a pH of 1.5. Upon initiation of the reflex, the release of gastrin by G-cells in the antrum of the stomach is shut off. This in turn inhibits gastric motility and the secretion of gastric acid (HCl). A reflex is a quick involuntary action. There are five steps to a reflex: the stimulus occurs, the sensory neurons sense the stimulus, it sends a message to your spinal cord (\u2026 it doesn't reach the brain right then), the spinal cord sends a message to your motor neurons, and the reflex occurs.

It normally takes thousands of years to progress. Eutrophication arises from the oversupply of nutrients, which induces explosive growth of plants and algae which, when such organisms die, consume the oxygen in the body of water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia. According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, the primary limiting factor for eutrophication is phosphate.. Cultural eutrophication is the process that speeds up natural eutrophication because of human activity. Due to clearing of land and building of towns and cities, land runoff is accelerated and more nutrients such as phosphates and nitrate are supplied to lakes and rivers, and then to coastal estuaries and bays. Photo by: Arvind Balaraman. Eutrophication (pronounced you-tro-fi-KAY-shun) is a natural process that occurs in an aging lake or pond as that body of water gradually builds up its concentration of plant nutrients. In nature, eutrophication is a common phenomenon in freshwater ecosystems and is really a part of the normal aging process of many lakes and ponds. Some never experience it because of a lack of warmth and light, but many do. Effects of eutrophication are:- 1.} Excessive growth of algae in the water bodies such as rivers etc. 2.} Depletion of oxygen in the water which results in the death of fishes \u2026 etc. and thus a clean water body turns into a stinking drain. Confidence votes 45. Cultural eutrophication is an increase in biological productivity and ecosystem succession caused by human activity. It is mainly caused by increased nutrient input into a water body. Increased productivity in an aquatic system sometimes can be beneficial. Cultural eutrophication is a form of water pollution. Cultural eutrophication also occurs when excessive fertilizers run into lakes and rivers. This encourages the growth of algae (algal bloom) and other aquatic plants. Following this, overcrowding occurs and plants compete for sunlight, space and oxygen.

Sedimentary rocks, formed from the products of weathering by cementation or precipitation on the Earth\u2019s surface. If the crystallization process occurs at the Earth's surface, the rocks created are called extrusive igneous rocks. Intrusive igneous rocks are rocks that form within the Earth's solid lithosphere. Intrusive igneous rocks can be brought to the surface of the Earth by denudation and by a variety of tectonic processes. The Lithosphere. The lithosphere is the solid outer part of the Earth. It consists of the crust and the solid part of the upper mantle. It has an average thickness of about 35 km and is constantly changing due to processes such as volcanic eruptions, running water and wave action. In geology, rock or stone is a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. For example, the common rock granite is a combination of the quartz, feldspar and biotite minerals. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock. Sedimentary sandstone with iron oxide bands. Sedimentary rocks are formed at the earth's surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water (sedimentation). Asthenosphere. Introduction. The asthenosphere is the layer of the Earth that lies below the lithosphere. It is a layer of solid rock that has so much pressure and heat the rocks can flow like a liquid. The rocks are less dense than the rocks in the lithosphere. This allows the tectonic plates in the lithosphere to move around on the Earth's surface by floating on the rocks that are slowly flowing like a liquid. Rocks in upper mantle. The rocks in the upper mantle can be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere. Lithosphere rocks are solid and rigid. Rocks below the lithosphere flow and break apart. 2. The earth's crust. The solid outer layer of the earth, the crust, consists of the CONTINENTAL CRUST, about 20-70 km thick, and the OCEANIC CRUST, which is thinner (5-10 km thick) and overlaid by the oceans. 3. Rocks and minerals. Rocks are solid pieces of the earth's crust, formed over very long periods of time The aggregate minerals forming the rock are held together by chemical bonds. The types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which the rock was formed. Many rocks contain silica (SiO 2); a compound of silicon and oxygen that forms 74.3% of the Earth's crust. Sedimentary sandstone with iron oxide bands. Sedimentary rocks are formed at the earth's surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water (sedimentation). Earth's lithosphere [edit]. Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The concept of the lithosphere as Earth\u2019s strong outer layer was described by A.E.H. Love in his 1911 monograph Some problems of Geodynamics and further developed by Joseph Barrell, who wrote a series of papers about the concept and introduced the term lithosphere. Quick cooling lavas are called volcanic rocks. Magma that cools slowly creates rocks like granite, which have large minerals that can be seen with the naked eye. These igneous rocks cool inside the lithosphere, and are called plutonic rocks. Sedimentary rocks form at the Earth\u2019s surface in two main ways. Clastic material (pieces of other rocks or fragments of skeletons) may become cemented together and chemical precipitation and evaporation can form sedimentary rocks.

When used with other treatments, hormone therapy can: 1 Make a tumor smaller before surgery or radiation therapy. 2 This is called neo-adjuvant therapy. 3 Lower the risk that cancer will come back after the main treatment. 4 This is called Hormone treatment is primarily used if prostate cancer has spread outside the prostate. It does not cure cancer. The purpose of hormone therapy is to delay the progression of the cancer and increase survival while maximizing quality of life. If a patient doesn't respond to initial hormone treatment, a doctor may try other hormonal methods before recommending chemotherapy. Hormone therapy is a form of systemic therapy that works to add, block or remove hormones from the body to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA), we use hormone therapy to fight various forms of cancer alongside Integrative Oncology Services to combat side effects. Hormone therapy usually involves taking medications that prevent cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. In some cases, your doctor may surgically remove the gland responsible for hormone production. How hormone therapy works. Some cancers use hormones to grow. These cancers are called hormone sensitive or hormone dependent. Hormone therapy uses drugs that either stop the body producing hormones or prevent hormones from making the cancer cells grow and divide. The female hormones oestrogen and progesterone affect some breast cancers. Doctors describe these cancers as oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) or progesterone receptor positive (PR+) or both. Hormone treatment for breast cancer works by stopping these hormones getting to the breast cancer cells. Hormonal therapy in oncology is hormone therapy for cancer and is one of the major modalities of medical oncology (pharmacotherapy for cancer), others being cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy (biotherapeutics). Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that slows or stops the growth of cancer that uses hormones to grow. Hormone therapy is also called hormonal therapy, hormone treatment, or endocrine therapy. When used with other treatments, hormone therapy can: 1 Make a tumor smaller before surgery or radiation therapy. 2 This is called neo-adjuvant therapy. 3 Lower the risk that cancer will come back after the main treatment. 4 This is called In this article. Hormones that every woman has in her body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can serve as fuel for some types of breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease. Tamoxifen is a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer. It works by blocking estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells. Doctors first used tamoxifen to treat women whose breast cancer had spread in their bodies because it slowed or stopped the growth of Hormonal therapy medicines are whole-body (systemic) treatment for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers. Hormone receptors are like ears on breast cells that listen to signals from hormones. These signals turn on growth in cells that have receptors. Most breast cancers are hormone-receptor-positive. 1 About 80% of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor positive. 2 About 65% of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers are also progesterone-receptor-positive. 3 About 13% of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor-positive and progesterone-receptor-negative. What hormone therapy is. Some cancers use these hormones to grow. Hormone therapy for cancer is the use of medicines to block the effects of hormones. It does not work for all types of cancer. Doctors use hormone therapy for people with cancers that are hormone sensitive or hormone dependent. The female hormones oestrogen and progesterone affect some breast cancers. Doctors describe these cancers as oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) or progesterone receptor positive (PR+) or both. Hormone treatment for breast cancer works by stopping these hormones getting to the breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy for breast cancer. Hormone therapy is another form of systemic therapy.

Single Gene Disorders. When a certain gene is known to cause a disease, we refer to it as a single gene disorder or a Mendelian disorder. For example, you may have heard of cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Fragile X syndrome, muscular dystrophy, or Huntington disease. These are all examples of single gene d Introduction. Quiz. If the changes in a genome are restricted to a single gene, a single-gene defect ensues. Usually this involves a point mutation and leads to an altered amino acid sequence in the proteins that are coded in this section of the DNA. Figure 1: Diagram of pleiotropy. A pleiotropic gene is a single gene that controls more than one trait. \u00a9 2008 Nature Education All rights reserved. Today, we know that Mendel's observations were the result of pleiotropy, or the phenomenon in which a single gene contributes to multiple phenotypic traits. Pleiotropy should not be confused with polygenic traits, in which multiple genes converge to result in a single phenotype. In some instances of pleiotropy, the influence of the single gene may be direct. For example, if a mouse is born blind due to any number of single-gene traits (Chang et al. , 2002), it is not surprising that this mouse would also do poorly in visual learning task A single gene trait is controlled by a single gene. Polygenic traits are controlled by two or more than two genes on different chromosomes. These genes are described as polyge \u2026 nes. Examples of human polygenic inheritance are height, skin color and weight. Polygenes allow a wide range of physical traits. Hairline, either straight or widow's peak, is a trait governed by a single gene. Another trait controlled by a single gene is the ability or inability to roll the tongue into \u2026 a U shape. 1 The Five Major Parts of the Brain At its most basic, the brain controls the body. A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes. Alternative splicing is a regulated process during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins.", "16031": "Flux is necessary to reduce the oxides that tend to form whenever you have hot metals in contact with the air. Soldering components is an essential element of electronics. Solder does not always bond well to components which can result in a bad solder joint, bridged pins, or even no joint at all.

The other theory was the heliocentric or Copernican theory which held that the sun was the center of the universe and that day and night were due to the rotation of the earth. This theory was named after a Catholic canon, Nicolaus Copernicus, who published a book on it 21 years before Galileo was born. Nicolaus Copernicus was the first astronomer to formulate a comprehensive heliocentric system. The Ptolemaic system put the Earth at the centre of the universe and \u2026 other objects go around it.

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) was a mathematician and astronomer who proposed that the sun was stationary in the center of the universe and the earth revolved around it. Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473, the youngest of four children of Nicolaus Copernicus, Sr., a well-to-do merchant who had moved to Torun from Cracow, and Barbara Watzenrode, the daughter of a leading merchant family in Torun. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 10/13. Copernicus first outlined his ideas about the heliocentric theory in a manuscript titled \u201cCommentariolus.\u201d There he suggested a heliostatic system, where the sun was at the center of the universe and the earth made rotations. Copernicus' Heliocentric theory: Unlike Ptolemy's theory the Earth was not the central body, the sun was. This explains why the planets occasionally appeared to be going bac \u2026 kward and how we got from day to night. Copernicus went against everyone else by implying the sun was central. Because having said that he could prove it, he had to admit that he could not. Although the heliocentric theory is accepted now, it was not accepted in Galileo's lifetime. \u2026 After his death scientific knowledge advanced to the point that everyone was forced to admit it was right. Copernicus' theory, also known as the heliocentric theory, basically stated that the sun was the center of the solar system and that the earth and the other planets revolved a \u2026 round it. This opposed Aristotle's geocentric theory. + 6 others found this useful.

Copernican heliocentrism is the name given to the astronomical model developed by Nicolaus Copernicus and published in 1543. It positioned the Sun near the center of the Universe, motionless, with Earth and the other planets rotating around it in circular paths modified by epicycles and at uniform speeds. The Copernican model departed from the Ptolemaic system that prevailed in Western culture for centuries, placing Earth at the center of the Universe, and is often regarded as the launching point to modern astronomy and the Scientific Revolution. In the early 1500s, when virtually everyone believed Earth was the center of the universe, Polish scientist Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that the planets instead revolved around the sun.

Each April on the anniversary of the first shots of the Civil War, many romanticize the Confederacy and the Lost Cause. For instance, we rarely hear about those southerners who opposed secession and were pro-Union in the Civil War. Many assume that, in 1861, every southerner was crowing for States Rights and eager to sever ties with her mother country. When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and, in the midst of the American Civil War, the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term.

Within the brain, the autonomic nervous system is regulated by the hypothalamus. Autonomic functions include control of respiration, cardiac regulation (the cardiac control center), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor center), and certain reflex actions such as coughing, sneezing, swallowing and vomiting. The autonomic nervous system has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is often considered the fight or flight system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the rest and digest or feed and breed system. The organs of our body (viscera), such as the heart, intestines and stomach, are regulated by a branch of the nervous system known as the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system and controls the function of many muscles, glands and organs within the body. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the involuntary division of the nervous system. It consists of autonomic neurons that conduct impulses from the central nervous system (brain and/or spinal cord) to glands, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The autonomic nervous system releases chemical messengers to influence its target organs. The most common are norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (Ach). All presynaptic neurons use Ach as a neurotransmitter. Ach is also released by some sympathetic postsynaptic neurons and all parasympathetic postsynaptic neurons. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the involuntary division of the nervous system. It consists of autonomic neurons that conduct impulses from the central nervous system (brain and/or spinal cord) to glands, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. (January 2009). The sympathetic nervous system is one of the two main divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the other being the parasympathetic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary process is to stimulate the body's fight-or-flight response. It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis. The Autonomic Nervous System is that part of PNS consisting of motor neurons that control internal organs. It has two subsystems. The autonomic system controls muscles in the heart, the smooth muscle in internal organs such as the intestine, bladder, and uterus. The Sympathetic Nervous System is involved in the fight or flight response. The Parasympathetic Nervous System is involved in relaxation. The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal.", "16291": "If you paper file, it will take three to four weeks for the IRS to process the return and acknowledge your refund.

Ask the breeder how they age them, some large breeders age them upon emergence into the pouch. If that is how they age them, subtract 60 days from their age. Stay with this plan, do not add or increase anything. They will eat more BML if needed, and less fruits and veggies. They also may want more insects, you can increase theirs by 1 or 2. If your glider has never been introduced to insects, it may SEEM like they do not like it, that is NOT the case. For Joeys that are under 8 weeks OOP, please use the JOEY BML. Ask the breeder how they age them, some large breeders age them upon emergence into the pouch. If that is how they age them, subtract 60 days from their age. While we do not yet have a description of the BML file format and what it is normally used for, we do know which programs are known to open these files. See the list of programs recommended by our users below. We are constantly working on adding more file type descriptions to the site-the current count exceeds thousand by far, and more information about BML files will hopefully be added soon. Broadcast Markup Language, or BML, is an XML-based standard developed by Japan's Association of Radio Industries and Businesses as a data broadcasting specification for digital television broadcasting. It was finalized in 1999, becoming ARIB STD-B24 Data Coding and Transmission Specification for Digital Broadcasting. The STD-B24 specification is derived from an early draft of XHTML 1.0 strict, which it extends and alters. Some subset of CSS 1 and 2 is supported, as well as ECMAScript. In the case that your BML file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit BML file extensions. If your PC opens the BML file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your Windows registry file association settings. In other words, Windows is associating BML file extensions with the wrong software program. BML File Opener. Download \u00bb. The fastest and easiest way to open your BML file is to double-click it. This allows the intelligence of Windows to decide the correct software application to open your BML file. User Rating.

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder. If the CFTR gene is defective, it results in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways. These blockages damage the lungs, digestive system and other organs, resulting in the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. The most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in two body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) system, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs. CF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility. Symptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinal symptoms often the first to appear. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease, meaning it is caused by a defect in the individual's genes. Genes control cell function by serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins.

Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis. Panniculitis occurs when there is inflammation of the layer of fat lying underneath the skin. The inflammation causes red rounded lumps (nodules) to form just below the skin surface, which are tender. Erythema (from the Greek erythros, meaning red) is redness of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by hyperemia of superficial capillaries. It occurs with any skin injury, infection, or inflammation. Examples of erythema not associated with pathology include nervous blushes. Erythema is a skin condition characterized by redness or rash. There are many types of erythema, including photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, and erythema nodusum. Photosensitivity is caused by a reaction to sunlight and tends to occur when something, such as an infection or a medication, increases your sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. Erythema multiforme is characterized by raised spots or other lesions on the skin. It is usually caused by a reaction to medications, infections (especially herpes simplex virus), or illness. Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory condition characterised by inflammation of the fat cells under the skin, resulting in tender red nodules or lumps that are usually seen on both shins. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and typically resolves spontaneously within 3\u20136 weeks. Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a part of the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs below the knees. The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from a dime to a quarter. Chronic erythema nodosum is a condition in which lesions pop up elsewhere, for a period of weeks to months. However, chronic erythema nodosum that may last for years is another pattern. Chronic erythema nodosum, with intermittent recurrences, can occur with or without an underlying disease present. Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a certain portion of the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum (also called EN) results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs below the knees. The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from one to five centimeters. The nodular swelling is caused by a inflammation in the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in three to six weeks. Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis that affects subcutaneous fat in the skin, usually first evident as an outcropping of erythematous nodules that are highly sensitive to touch. 1 Most nodules are located symmetrically on the ventral aspect of the lower extremities. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis.

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). 1 Subspace models: in Biclustering (also known as Co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes. 2 Group models: some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information. Clustering Clustering is similar to another process called Brainstorming. Clustering is something that you can do on your own or with friends or classmates to try to find inspiration in the connection between ideas. k-means clustering is a partitioning method. The function kmeans partitions data into k mutually exclusive clusters, and returns the index of the cluster to which it has assigned each observation. Unlike hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering operates on actual observations (rather than the larger set of dissimilarity measures), and creates a single level of clusters. The distinctions mean that k-means clustering is often more suitable than hierarchical clustering for large amounts of data. Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. 1 Subspace models: in Biclustering (also known as Co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes. 2 Group models: some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information. It was asserted in that the relaxed solution of k-means clustering, specified by the cluster indicators, is given by the PCA (principal component analysis) principal components, and the PCA subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace. In cluster analysis, the k-means algorithm can be used to partition the input data set into k partitions (clusters). However, the pure k-means algorithm is not very flexible, and as such is of limited use (except for when vector quantization as above is actually the desired use case!). The goal is to assign a cluster to each data point. K-means is a clustering method that aims to find the positions $\\b{\\mu}_i,i=1...k$ of the clusters that minimize the distance from the data points to the cluster. Clustering is the process of partitioning a group of data points into a small number of clusters."}
