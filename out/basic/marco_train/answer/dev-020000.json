Since these structures are typical of rabies infection of the brain, they have a diagnostic value and have been used as definite histological proof of such infection. The rabies virus is usually transmitted via an animal bite, however, cases have also been reported in which the virus penetrated the body through infected saliva, moist tissues such as the eyes or lips, a scratch on the skin, or the transplantation of infected tissues. The present study characterizes the morphogenesis and functions of the IBs that are found in the cytoplasm of cells infected by rabies virus. We show that these IBs have staining characteristics that are similar to those of the Negri bodies found in certain nerve Rabies is transferred to humans through the bite of an infected animal. In the case of humans, the most common mode of transmission is through dog bites. Rabies is endemic throughout the world except in Australia, Japan, Great Britain, Hawaii, and many smaller islands including most of the islands of the Caribbean. Abstract. Rabies virus (RABV) is a negative-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is tightly encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (N) and this RNA\u2013N complex is the template for transcription and replication by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and its cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P). Rabies is an acute viral disease of the central nervous system that affects humans and other mammals but is most common in carnivores (flesh-eaters). It is sometimes referred to as a zoonosis, or disease of animals that can be communicated to humans. Rabies virus infection induces the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that resemble Negri bodies found in the cytoplasm of some infected nerve cells. ABSTRACT.

PROTHROMBIN GENE MUTATION Prothrombin gene mutation is the second most common cause of inherited thrombophilia in the United States. It is present in about 2% of Caucasians. It is caused by a cha nge or mutation in the gene for the blood clotting protein called prothrombin (which is also called Factor II). People with the prothrombin gene mutation have higher than normal levels of prothrombin in their blood, making them prone to blood clots, most common in the veins. People who have prothrombin mutation G20210A have a 2-to-3 fold increase in the risk of DVT. Persons who have this mutation plus the Factor V Leiden mutation have a 10-to-20 fold increase in thrombotic risk. Prothrombin mutations have also been linked with thrombotic events other than DVT, including recurrent miscarriage (repeat spontaneous abortions). It raises the risk of thrombosis significantly for both males and females in all age groups.

The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. The first systematic measurements of human body temperature were performed by the German physician Carl Wunderlich. In 1861 he measured the temperatures of one million healthy individuals (a sample size that seems too large to be believed). The average value was reported as 37 Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) or more above or below 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day.

It is also known as a squawker. A mid-range driver is called upon to handle the most significant part of the audible sound spectrum, the region where the most fundamentals emitted by musical instruments and, most importantly, the human voice, lie. Best Answer: In a two-way system there is a woofer and tweeter that together produce the range of frequencies. In a three-way system a mid-range speaker produces a mid-range of frequencies. This places less burden on the woofer and tweeter, typically reducing distortion. However a carefully designed crossover network is normally required for good results. The audio spectrum is the audible frequency range at which humans can hear. The range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and can be effectively broken down into seven different frequency bands, with each having a different impact on the total sound. Midrange: 500 Hz to 2 kHz. The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn like quality.

Land inside the urban growth boundary supports urban services such as roads, water and sewer systems, parks, schools and fire and police protection. The boundary is one of the tools to protect farms and forests from urban sprawl and promote the efficient use of land, public facilities and services inside the boundary. Legislating for an urban growth boundary is one way, among many others, of managing the major challenges posed by unplanned urban growth and the encroachment of cities upon agricultural and rural land. Summary. An urban growth boundary (UGB) is a line drawn on a map that separates areas where government policies encourage urban development from areas where government policy encourage agriculture, silviculture and other non-developmental rural activities. Typical goals of a UGBs are the: An Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) is a zoning tool that maintains a relatively high density of housing and commercial development inside the boundary and a rural density outside the boundary. An urban growth boundary circumscribes an entire urbanized area and is used by local governments as a guide to zoning and land use decisions. (Redirected from Urban Growth Boundary).

There are measurable mutation rates and that there can be a genetic variation for mutation rates; mutator strains of bacteria exist. Mutations in the replication or repair machinery of DNA can alter mutation rates. In order for a mutation to be inherited, it must occur in the genetic material of a sex cell. It is likely that most sex cells contain gene mutations of some sort. It is now thought that the frequency of new mutations in humans is about 1 for every 10,000 genes per generation. Mutations. Mutation is a change in DNA, the hereditary material of life. An organism's DNA affects how it looks, how it behaves, and its physiology all aspects of its life.

In other words, a strong acid is a good proton donor. For example, the strong acid HCl gives up all its protons to water: Weak bases exist in chemical equilibrium much in the same way as weak acids do, with a base dissociation constant (Kb) indicating the strength of the base. For example, when ammonia is put in water, the following equilibrium is set up: Bases that have a large K b will ionize more completely and are thus stronger bases.
