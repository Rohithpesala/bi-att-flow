Best Answer: Notochord is the skeletal rod which lies lengthwise between the central nervous system and the alimentary canal or the gut and the chordates possess it at young stage of development. In adult vertebrates, it is replaced by vertebral column. On the other hand a nerve cord is a solid strand of nervous tissue, forming part of central nervous system, especially of invertebrates. The main difference between the two is that notochord is a part of skeleton system whereas nerve cord is a part of nervous system. Source(s): Shewta \u00b7 2 years ago. Thumbs up. 2 The dorsal nerve cord is a hollow cord dorsal to the notochord.It is formed from a part of the ectoderm that rolls, forming the hollow tube, compared to other animal phyla, which have solid, ventral tubes. The dorsal nerve cord is later modified into the brain and spinal cord.

To compare agricultural commodity prices in different countries, conversions often need to be made between the U.S. system and the metric system. When converting livestock prices (see Table 1), the basic conversion is based on converting pounds to kilograms. Some of our traditional terms are more complicated to convert from one system to another. Grain yields for example are conventionally expressed in terms of volume per acre (bu/a). In the metric system, yield is given by weight (kilograms per hectare). Most of the world does its measuring in meters, grams, and liters.

Acute gastritis involves sudden, severe inflammation, while chronic gastritis involves long-term inflammation that can last for years, if left untreated. Gastritis can be caused by irritation due to excessive alcohol use, chronic vomiting, stress, or the use of certain medications, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. It may also be caused by any of the following: 1 Helicobacter pylori: A bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach.

Though baking powder has a neutral pH7 value, it made the food product tastes bitter after the baking process when you used too much baking powder. This is mainly because of other ingredients used. For example, flour has ph value of 5.5-6.5. Too much baking powder can cause the batter to be bitter tasting. It can also cause the batter to rise rapidly and then collapse. (i.e. The air bubbles in the batter grow too large and break causing the batter to fall.) Cakes will have a coarse, fragile crumb with a fallen center. Both baking powder and baking soda are chemical leavening agents that cause batters to rise when baked. The leavener enlarges the bubbles which are already present in the batter produced through creaming of ingredients. Make sure to bake the batter immediately.

How Biofuel is Made. The energy that we get from biofuels originally came from the sun. This solar energy was captured through photosynthesis by the plants used as feedstocks (raw materials) for biofuel production, and stored in the plants' cells. Many different plant materials can be used for biofuel: Several characteristics of algae give them big advantages when it comes to biofuels. 1 Algae can produce between 2,000-5,000 gallons of fuel per acre, far more than any other renewable feedstock. 2 Algae can grow on marginal, or non-crop, land, so they don\u2019t compete with valuable agricultural land. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution. For the future, many think a better way of making biofuels will be from grasses and saplings, which contain more cellulose. Cellulose is the tough material that makes up plants' cell walls, and most of the weight of a plant is Why Biodiesel is Good. 1.

The breeding lifespan of a rabbit is variable. The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world, one of which is the Belgian Hare, imported into England in the mid 19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great rabbit boom. 1 The rabbits are fairly large in size and they can eat a lot. 2 Flemish giant rabbits eat the same diet as a regular rabbit, but they eat a lot more since the food intake is proportional to the size of the animal. 3 Nutrition experts suggest hay and occasional treats. 4 Rabbit feed can be purchased at your local pet store. 1 Bundy Cowgirl is a website owned by an individual that sells different kinds of Flemish giant rabbits. 2 These rabbits are from Australia and can grow very large. 3 The rabbits are shipped throughout the world and they can be purchased for $200 to $330. The Flemish Giant is also called the king of rabbits because of his large size, longevity and personality. These rabbits can reach immense size very quickly. By seven or eight weeks of age, they can already weigh four pounds or more. According to the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA), there is no maximum weight for a Flemish Giant.

Recombinant DNA (or rDNA) is made by combining DNA from two or more sources. In practice, the process often involves combining the DNA of different organisms. There are two types of gene cloning: in vivo, which involves the use of restriction enzymes and ligases using vectors and cloning the fragments into host cells (as can be seen in the image above). The other type is in vitro which is using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to create copies of fragments of DNA. Conjugation and Plasmids In a process called conjugation, genetic material is transferred between two bacterial cells (of same or different species) that are temporarily joined. The DNA transfer is one way: One cell donates the DNA,a nd the other receives ti. The donor uses sex pili to attach to the recipient. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells. In transduction, bacteriophage carry bacterial genes from one hose cell to another; transduction is a type of horizontal gene transfer. Answer Organisms all possess DNA as their genetic material. What differentiates them (and their DNA) is the sequence of base-pairs within the DNA. The base-pairs \u2026 are actually specific sequences of nucleotides (i.e. adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, labelled A, T, G, and C respectively) which encode genes. DNA = Deoxyribonucleic acid Deoxyribose is a sugar that differs from another sugar called ribose (ribo) by missing one oxygen atom (deoxy). Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by the combination of at least two strands. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called chimeric DNA, because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical chimera.

Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Opposite of a convergent boundary, a divergent boundary is formed by the spreading of a tectonic plate. This process feeds magma to the surface, creating new crust. Divergent zones in oceanic plates form a geological feature called a ridge, forced upward by the pressure of the rising magma. The third type of plate boundary occurs where tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary. As the plates rub against each other, huge stresses are set up that can cause portions of the rock to break, resulting in earthquakes. In the theory of plate tectonics, the earth's crust is broken into plates that move around relative to each other. As a result of this movement, three types of plate boundaries are formed: divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries. Plates move away from one another at divergent boundaries. This happens at mid-ocean ridges. Plates move towards one another at convergent boundaries; one plate is forced below another in a process called subduction. Earthquakes and composite volcanoes are common at this type of boundary. Some features, such as earthquakes and volca-noes, are more common at tectonic plate boundaries than at other places on Earth.

Most websites I've come across attribute the heart rate increase to the caffeine content, but since coffee (which contains m \u2026 ore than double the amount of caffeine that soda pop does on average) does not increase my heart rate, I will attribute the cause to the carbon dioxide. So breathing does not increase or decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Judy Olmsted. 79,105 Contributions. Retired college science professor.

Klezmer is one of those you-know-it-when-you-hear-it music genres that has a nostalgic, Old World sound. The music that we identify as klezmer today harkens back to the Jewish music played in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Because klezmer borrows so much from other styles of music, one way to identify klezmer is by the types of instruments that are used -- as well as those that aren't. Later, the violin served as the lead instrument in traditional klezmer, and it continues to be used in many klezmer revival groups. Today, the clarinet is considered to be essential to klezmer music, but it wasn't until the mid-and late-19th century that the clarinet started to take over as the lead instrument.

DESCRIPTION. A variety of problems can cause hand stiffness, limiting the use and function that we often take for granted. Stiffness can occur when there are problems within and around the structures of a joint, including ligaments and muscles. Some of these problems may include: 1 Arthritis. 2 Fractures. 3 Dislocations. 4 Bad sprains. There are 2 types of stiffness: it can mean a reduction in the overall range of movement i.e. the extent of the bending or straightening possible in a joint or series of joints; and it can mean a lack of easy flow within that range of movement. Stiffness can be due to joint problems i.e. the underlying structure is abnormal or it can occur due to soft tissue problems which prevent full movement. The commonest cause is arthritis in a joint (see information sheet). Stiffness. Stiff hand (symptom description): Stiff hand is listed as a type of or related-symptom for symptom Stiffness.

They often have a lower interest rate, and it can be easier to qualify for than a traditional 30-year-fixed mortgage. There is, however, a risk to consider. If you take out a mortgage with a 30-year term, your monthly payments are calculated by amortizing the loan over 360 months. Balloon mortgages generally calculate payments over a 30-year term but have a maturity date (when a balloon payment is due) of three to 10 years. Although you can shop for mortgage terms in five-year increments ranging from 15 to 40 years, 15- and 30-year terms are the most common for fixed mortgages, according to MSN Money. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) almost always come with a 15- or 30-year term. Different lenders may have slight variations in the terms of balloon mortgages. A typical balloon mortgage has an initial term of 5 or 7 years before the balloon payment is due, although lenders can set the term from 1 to 25 years. Some lenders require interest-only payments during the term of the loan, while others require payments that pay towards both the interest and principal. The advantage of this loan is a lower mortgage rate and payment. If, for example, 30-year fixed rates are 4.00 percent, a five year balloon mortgage might have an interest rate of 2.5 percent. For a $200,000 home loan, the 30-year loan payment would be $955, while the balloon mortgage payment would be $790. What is a Ballon Payment. A balloon mortgage is a mortgage that does not fully amortize over the term of the loan, and therefore, a large portion of the principal balance is repaid with a single payment at the end of its term (hence the term, balloon payment)).", "15509": "NDVI is an index which measures this difference, providing a measure of vegetation density and condition.", "15511": "Scientists in Scotland", "15513": "$75 to as much as $450 per procedure.", "18925": "day every day. 2 The medication is used to prevent asthma attacks, not to treat them. 3 You should test spray a Qvar inhaler before your first use of it or if you have not used it for more than ten days. 1 You should test spray a Qvar inhaler before your first use of it or if you have not used it for more than ten days.", "15515": "reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities.", "15516": "gradually evolved from a common ancestor, their DNA, passed from generation to generation, changed too.", "15517": "Ceres is a dwarf planet, the only one located in the inner reaches of the solar system; the rest lie at the outer edges, in the Kuiper Belt.", "15518": "James Lipton", "15519": "To look up the number of shares outstanding and the current price per share, you can use financial analysis", "15521": "The exclamation mark (British English) or exclamation point", "15522": "is a disease of the nervous system in deer and elk that results in distinctive brain lesions.
