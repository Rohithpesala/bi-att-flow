But that request was denied , as Savoie earlier said he had no concerns about Martin hearing the matter . Following the summer trip , Noriko Savoie did return to the United States , and Christopher Savoie then took the children on a vacation , returning them to his ex-wife , his attorney , Paul Bruno , told CNN . Watch latest report on Savoie 's situation \"  But days later , on the first day of classes for 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca , the school called Savoie to say his children had n't arrived , Bruno said . Police checked Noriko Savoie 's home and did not find the children . Concerned , Savoie called his ex-wife 's father in Japan , who told him not to worry . \"  I said , ` What do you mean -- do n't worry ? They were n't at school . ' ` Oh , do n't worry , they are here , ' \"  Savoie recounted the conversation to CNN affiliate WTVF earlier this month . \"  I said , ` They are what , they are what , they are in Japan ? ' \"  The very thing that Savoie had predicted in court papers had happened -- his wife had taken their children to Japan and showed no signs of returning , Bruno said . After Noriko Savoie took the children to Japan , Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children , Bruno said . And Franklin police issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife , the television station reported . But there was a major hitch : Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on international child abduction . The international agreement standardizes laws , but only among participating countries . So while Japanese civil law stresses that courts resolve custody issues based on the best interest of the children without regard to either parent 's nationality , foreign parents have had little success in regaining custody . Japanese family law follows a tradition of sole custody divorces . When a couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children . In court documents filed in May , Noriko Savoie denied that she was failing to abide by the terms of the couple 's court-approved parenting plan or ignoring court-appointed parent coordinators . She added she was \"  concerned about the stability of Father , his extreme antagonism towards Mother and the effect of this on the children . \"  Noriko Savoie could not be reached by CNN for comment . Bruno said he helped Christopher Savoie pursue legal remedies to recover the children , working with police , the FBI and the State Department . \"  We tried to do what we could to get the kids back , \"  Bruno said . \"  There was not a whole lot we can do . \"  \"  Our court system failed him , \"  said Diane Marshall , a court-appointed parent coordinator who helped Savoie make decisions about the children . \"  It 's just a mess . \"  But Moses , Noriko Savoie 's attorney , told CNN that the children 's father had other legal options . The International Association for Parent-Child Reunion , formed in Japan this year , claims to know of more than 100 cases of children abducted by non-custodial Japanese parents . And the U.S. State Department says it is not aware of a single case in which a child taken from the United States to Japan has been ordered returned by Japanese courts -- even when the left-behind parent has a U.S. custody decree . Facing such statistics and the possibility of never seeing his kids again , Savoie took matters into his own hands . He flew to Fukuoka . And as his ex-wife walked the two children to school Monday morning , Savoie drove alongside them . He grabbed the kids , forced them into his car , and drove off , said police in Fukuoka . Watch CNN panel discuss Savoie 's legal options \"  He headed for the U.S. consulate in that city to try to obtain passports for Isaac and Rebecca . But Japanese police , alerted by Savoie 's ex-wife , were waiting . Consulate spokeswoman Tracy Taylor said she heard a scuffle outside the doors of the consulate . She ran up and saw a little girl and a man , whom police were trying to talk to . Eventually , police took Savoie away , charging him with the abduction of minors -- a charge that carries a jail sentence of up to five years . Bruno said if the situation were reversed and a Japanese parent had abducted a Japanese child and fled to America , U.S. courts would \"  correct that problem , because it 's a crime . \"  He said he has \"  concerns about Japan ... providing a place for people to abduct children and go to .

Most kidnappings are n't reported , he said , because the victims are generally smugglers , drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three . Other criminals targeted The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones . In some cases , a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment , but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom , which can be between $ 30,000 and $ 250,000 , Thompson said . \"  -LSB- The victims are -RSB- wearing the doper bling-bling , and they target them , \"  he said . \"  We 've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $ 1 million that the person has asked for . In addition to that , they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana , perhaps a pound or two of speed , a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin . \"  Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them , Burgett said . Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote 's patrons , known as pollos -LRB- Spanish for chickens -RRB- , Burgett said . Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country . See what other cities have a cartel presence There are rarely \"  true victims \"  in Phoenix 's kidnappings , the lieutenant said . However , one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"  uglier than the drug trade \"  and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes ' bidding when they ca n't come up with the ransoms . \"  In the drug business , the people getting killed are in the business . They are not end users , not consumers , \"  said Antonio Bustamente . \"  In the coyote business , the people killed are really innocent . -LSB- First-time -RSB- illegal entry is a petty offense . \"  Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix 's border-related violence , police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark . Girl mistakenly snatched On the evening of March 17 , 2008 , a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale . They were planning to play basketball . The friend , according to a police investigative report , was the niece of a man named \"  Chucky . \"  Chucky and his cohorts , witnesses told police , had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house . Hours later , the investigative report said , armed men arrived at Chucky 's sister 's house in three vehicles , one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use . The men wanted Chucky , their drugs or $ 24,000 . The 13-year-old said she did n't know Chucky . When she tried to walk away , \"  one of them grabbed her by the neck , pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle , \"  the report said . Eventually , the men called the girl 's mother to demand ransom . A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl . She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise . The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border , collateral damage is a reality . Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \"  The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence . The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him . On Andrade 's third day in captivity , an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $ 50,000 to $ 10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen . When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point , a Safeway supermarket parking lot , police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe , the report said . One of the men , Luis Alberto Castro-Vega , then 23 , disclosed Andrade 's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping . Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade 's kidnapping : first-degree burglary , theft by extortion , armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault .", "90ba568443486427c40cb12268d3e14629ded9f44": "There 's no doubt \"  that the deadly attack on India 's financial capital last month was planned inside Pakistan , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Sunday .

Even more important was his subsequent statement : \"  To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . \"  In traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years , I heard several anti-American comments ; these Europeans were challenging me , a Muslim , about American foreign policy in Palestine , Iraq and Afghanistan . In Muslim countries , I 've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America , followed by accusations that , \"  your President Bush does n't like us Muslims . \"  As a Muslim-American , I have found myself in a difficult position . In America , I 've had to explain Islam to other Americans , and abroad , I 've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world . Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world . For me personally , it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims . And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions . In his first steps as president , Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison , called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process , as special envoy for the Middle East . For the past few weeks , I 've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama 's recent actions . Obama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not : Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world . There is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed 's that the Muslim community is like one body : If one part hurts , the entire body feels the pain . Muslims are very aware of this message and , in the last 20 years , three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness : Chechnya , Kashmir and , most notably , Palestine . Obama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya , indicating he would actively engage Arab media . The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview , with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict . To understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America 's role in the conflict , one must realize the situation he walked into as president . Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration . Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed .", "ba0872b6fcb2e98fec0e8293a13278a0218e2aa98": "Jonathan Breeze", "58df09b4ed4c8d7e16e31357a5308db8aee65c990": "also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms .", "8d7838f8a667e5850ab673a39a7d9fedc2d700446": "It 's known that many of the successes have come from the work done by military intelligence and investigation .", "e6a0044bc6f523d049c959c50b57d39656621cb30": "$ 5.5 billion", "7a6617bc038160b31c4c44a132f8700c568e3b855": "1974 .", "95de1a83db8617658b4f0cbbdd5d9aeb1a7dbf5f0": "Authorities have recovered 54 bodies after a ferry crammed with people capsized in southern Bangladesh , police said Sunday .", "e3900a490f87e73a03763a932dc239afd10d64051": "Stokes", "36657d5615554d881c4c62d34b01e55809b674d45": "1962", "eab4ae7e8bb692c2750d0090511eaaa987b5da003": "music company said in a statement .", "c9cb3b65f68f8b52d4bdb84a09bf86b9fa2001213": "Chicago Spire", "762b1a25e465360f62cbe7cb6480e8845c3917ff6": "Little Rock said he did not know Bledsoe .

What can I do ? -- Frank Santa Maria , New Braunfels , Texas A : Expedia should have spelled your wife 's name correctly . When it was clear that the company had made an error , it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline . Then again , it should have never come to this . First , why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets ? It may be more convenient , but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online . It 's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger 's name . Second , you should always check your verification e-mail immediately . Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier . It 's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible . Believe me , I know .

He 's reported in guarded condition at the University of Miami 's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center , where he 's been in a private room since the incident . Gordon Weekes , the attorney for Bent , denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults . \"  It 's been decided by society that a 15-year-old ca n't vote , ca n't join the armed forces and can not buy alcohol , because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions , \"  he said . \"  But they can treat them as adults in court , when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system , which is geared toward rehabilitation , \"  he said . Weekes said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond . Detectives say witnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him . They said Matthew Bent encouraged the attack . Authorities say Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire , and that he made a \"  bad decision , \"  according to an arrest transcript . Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff 's Office have been unable to interview Brewer . Until last week , he had been on a ventilator to keep him alive . \"  We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week , \"  said sheriff 's spokesman Jim Leljedal . \"  Detectives have been waiting for him to recover to the point where he 's strong enough to give us a complete statement , \"  he said . Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections . Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks ; his face and hands were largely spared , doctors say . Brewer 's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries . \"  They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting , but his parents are with him all the time , \"  said Lorraine Nelson , a hospital spokeswoman . \"  I do n't tell him what happened , \"  Brewer 's mother , Valerie , told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV . \"  I just tell him he 's in the hospital and he 's safe and he 's getting better . \"  And he 'll say , ` Am I going to be OK ? ' And I say ` Yes , Michael . You 're going to be fine . You 're going to be just fine , ' \"  she said .

When Kim Jong Il , his oldest son , succeeded him , North Korea was crippled economically , having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed . Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime 's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy , U.S.-backed south . What military hardware does North Korea have ? But with Kim dead , Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor , perhaps even paving the way for reunification . \"  Most people , whether left or right on the political spectrum , hope this is the case , \"  he said . \"  However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification , citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s . \"  Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run .

Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s . \"  There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you wo n't last long .

Earlier this year , Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions . Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"  pleased \"  with the FDA 's order but added \"  there is still more that the FDA must do . \"  \"  The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions , such as tendon pain , so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture , \"  the group said . \"  We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures . \"  When asked about the lawsuit and why it did n't order the \"  black box \"  label warning until now , Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004 , and updated the information last year .

Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals , which markets Levaquin in the United States , also said it would abide by the FDA 's request . Merck & Co. , the maker of Noroxin , said it , too , would update the drug 's label . But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form .

The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times , according to the FDA 's Dr. Renata Albrecht . \"  This risk is further increased in those over age 60 , in kidney , heart , and lung transplant recipients , and with use of concomitant steroid therapy , \"  the FDA said in a statement . Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon . \"  Sometimes it 's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning , \"  she said . Normally , she added , that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"  a week or two before the patient will rupture . \"  Public Citizen , founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader , said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007 . \"  Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA , the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher , \"  the group said .

The Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners , a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies . Sunday 's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs , chicken , burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies . \"  When you 're going into a restaurant environment , you 're putting your child 's safety and livelihood into other hands , \"  Tara Zinna said . At the Worry Free Dinners event , \"  not only was the food phenomenal , but it 's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues . \"  The recent \"  worry free \"  meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration 's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels . Since 2006 , food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk , eggs , fish , shellfish , peanuts , tree nuts , wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit . Restaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies . When the meal arrives , there 's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it , or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it . You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests . But with Worry Free Dinners , everyone has some kind of experience with all of that , which helps build camaraderie , said Sloane Miller , who started organizing the events in April . Read more tips on how to manage food allergies \"  \"  People sit down and start chatting immediately like they 're old friends , \"  said Miller , known in the blogosphere as \"  Allergic Girl . \"  \"  It 's so nice to be with people that you do n't have to explain -LSB- to -RSB- why you want something on the side . \"  So far , Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America , according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network -LRB- FAAN -RRB- -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities . A common but mysterious condition One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy , and some will outgrow their sensitivities , said Anne Munoz-Furlong , founder and CEO of FAAN . But allergies to peanuts , nuts , shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong , she said . As far as she knows , Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind . Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise , but no one is sure why . Research on food allergies has been slow because \"  for a long time , people thought this was a small problem , \"  Munoz-Furlong said . The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress , including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies , she said . The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"  cyclic , \"  with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies : sneezing , itchy eyes , and nasal congestion , said Dr. Alpen Patel , assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University . Other people experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods . But for some people , ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis , a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways , cardiovascular collapse , and even death . This is called a \"  fixed food allergy , \"  he said . After one severe reaction , he said , most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack . But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis . Enjoying food in spite of allergies Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals , whether at Thanksgiving or on a date , without feeling sick . She runs her own coaching practice , blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc. . She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow 's milk , and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts . She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon , lemon grass , eggplant , some types of melons and most tropical fruits .

Air France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa . The Intertropical Convergence Zone , which circles the Earth near the equator , is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean . While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane 's crash , the tragedy does call attention to the region . The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet . Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet . High pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator . On the flip side , air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere . The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"  trade winds \"  and converge in the middle of the tropics . That 's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from . Here , air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s . The warm , moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun . Steamy air , coming off the ocean , rises until it hits cooler , drier air aloft , forming clouds and thunderstorms . These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph . The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air . Even if you stacked two dozen of the world 's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other , they still would n't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ . Former Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane 's disappearance on his Web site , weathergraphics.com . \"  Based on the infrared satellite imagery , I was able to ... estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet , \"  he told CNN in a phone interview .

The Indian Embassy in Kabul was badly damaged in the July 7 bombing . Pakistan strongly denied the allegation Friday , but Afghanistan and India have previously accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack which killed 58 people including an Indian defense attache . The official told CNN the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a \"  strong suspicion \"  the Taliban was behind the attack , and that some unspecified aid came from Pakistan 's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence , or ISI . The official would not say how the intelligence was gathered , but he said the evidence was presented to senior Pakistani officials by a top CIA official , Deputy Director Stephen Kappes . The New York Times , sourcing U.S. government officials , reported Friday that the United States intercepted communications between Pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in Kabul . Pakistani Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said the report \"  unfounded and malicious \"  and an \"  effort to malign the ISI , \"  -- Pakistan 's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence . The bombing killed 58 people . \"  The ISI is a very disciplined organization , manned by military officials . It has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al Qaeda , the Taliban , and those linked to the attack on mainland America on 9/11 , \"  Abbas said . Abbas said \"  despite our insistence , no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations . \"  Afghanistan claims Pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in Pakistan 's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share . Earlier this month , Afghan lawmakers directly accused Pakistan 's ISI in connection with a string of attacks in Afghanistan . Among these were the Kabul strike and an assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai at an April 27 military ceremony . A senior Afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in Kabul with ISI officers in Pakistan . A U.S. government official , who would not comment on the specifics of the New York Times story , said , \"  We 've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the ISI and the Taliban , and the incident at the Indian Embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports . \"  India has previously blamed militants from Pakistan for the July 7 car bombing at the embassy .

Police have recently stepped up their efforts to crack down on drug use at clubs and bars in Hong Kong and Shenzhen , a city in mainland China just across the border . Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong , mostly under the age of 30 , were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here . However , narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse . \"  Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds . That 's what our recent data from last year shows , \"  Fok said . \"  They want to find some other places to take drugs . \"  The problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before : random school drug tests . Beginning in September , some two dozen schools will conduct tests , as part of a trial program . Officials say the drug screening will most likely be in the form of urine tests , though they are still working out the details .

I only had one student who was 15 , \"  he said . \"  But now , I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger . That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger . \"  There were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs , such as troubled homes and difficulties at school , he said . \"  People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost , \"  he added . Hong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses , according to Commissioner for Narcotics , Sally Wong . Police last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs -- mainly to students . One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine , according to the South China Morning Post . But ketamine abuse is not limited to young people . It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong , Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said . Many young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan 's drug rehab school for youth , which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong . CNN visited the campus , which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls . The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods . Chan calls the school \"  the last stop before jail \"  for drug abusers . That was the case for Tai Ming Hung 's son Keith , a former gang member . She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago . \"  I was in denial . I just did n't believe it was true . When I first heard about it , we all did n't know how to react , because we had n't heard of those drugs before , \"  she said . \"  I did n't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world .

Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs , which still use wires , many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals . Hacking into these devices could enable patients to \"  self-prescribe \"  elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain 's reward centers . Despite the risks , Kohno said , most new devices are n't created with security in mind . Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment , and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines . But until now , few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions . This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of \"  neurosecurity , \"  a term the group coined to describe their field . \"  The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by , \"  Kohno said . \"  I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security . \"  Kevin Otto , a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty , said he was initially skeptical of the research . \"  When I first picked up the paper , I do n't know if I agreed that it was an issue . But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important , and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers . \"  It 's never too early to start thinking about security issues , said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin , who was not involved in the research . But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack , and that fear of future risks should n't impede progress in the field . \"  These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology , \"  Williams said . History provides plenty of examples of why it 's important to think about security before it becomes a problem , Kohno said . Perhaps the best example is the Internet , which was originally conceived as a research project and did n't take security into account . \"  Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind , \"  the researchers wrote , \"  it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today 's security goals . \"  Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world , by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality .", "4612f792250e9a7d18290c1236c1e969cda72afe6": "Maradona", "6935e09175390c03b40d06280fe7c01d2f1629c03": "Arkansas Attorney", "ec85ff070156e76ef37172ef705391d7fc3185500": "a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country .

Most kidnappings are n't reported , he said , because the victims are generally smugglers , drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three . Other criminals targeted The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones . In some cases , a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment , but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom , which can be between $ 30,000 and $ 250,000 , Thompson said . \"  -LSB- The victims are -RSB- wearing the doper bling-bling , and they target them , \"  he said . \"  We 've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $ 1 million that the person has asked for . In addition to that , they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana , perhaps a pound or two of speed , a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin . \"  Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them , Burgett said . Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote 's patrons , known as pollos -LRB- Spanish for chickens -RRB- , Burgett said . Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country . See what other cities have a cartel presence There are rarely \"  true victims \"  in Phoenix 's kidnappings , the lieutenant said . However , one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"  uglier than the drug trade \"  and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes ' bidding when they ca n't come up with the ransoms . \"  In the drug business , the people getting killed are in the business . They are not end users , not consumers , \"  said Antonio Bustamente . \"  In the coyote business , the people killed are really innocent . -LSB- First-time -RSB- illegal entry is a petty offense . \"  Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix 's border-related violence , police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark . Girl mistakenly snatched On the evening of March 17 , 2008 , a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale . They were planning to play basketball . The friend , according to a police investigative report , was the niece of a man named \"  Chucky . \"  Chucky and his cohorts , witnesses told police , had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house . Hours later , the investigative report said , armed men arrived at Chucky 's sister 's house in three vehicles , one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use . The men wanted Chucky , their drugs or $ 24,000 . The 13-year-old said she did n't know Chucky . When she tried to walk away , \"  one of them grabbed her by the neck , pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle , \"  the report said . Eventually , the men called the girl 's mother to demand ransom . A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl . She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise . The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border , collateral damage is a reality . Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \"  The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence . The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him . On Andrade 's third day in captivity , an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $ 50,000 to $ 10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen . When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point , a Safeway supermarket parking lot , police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe , the report said . One of the men , Luis Alberto Castro-Vega , then 23 , disclosed Andrade 's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping . Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade 's kidnapping : first-degree burglary , theft by extortion , armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault .", "4b3c67642970c39ac3ce9e0573d03fc40fa20b9611": "He had a rough life during the Ice Age , walking around with a couple of broken ribs and a possibly cancerous lesion on his jaw before dying at a young age .

Page Museum . Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles . An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth 's skull , according to project director Christopher Shaw . \"  The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper , \"  Shaw told CNN Thursday . \"  We do n't know just how smashed up it is , but it 's fairly intact because it 's a huge jacket we put it around . \"  The mammoth 's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"  tree-boxed \"  along with the surrounding dirt , creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact . Zed 's remains were encased in a plaster jacket . The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones . Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum , who began analyzing the various fossils in June , Shaw said . \"  It 's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years , \"  Shaw said . John Harris , the head curator of the Page Museum , publicly announced the finding of \"  a whole new treasure trove of fossils \"  on Wednesday . He described it as \"  the most important discovery \"  for the museum \"  of the last 90 years . \"  Shaw said the announcement was made to \"  create interest \"  in the museum 's discovery . Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed , who is believed to have died in his late 40s . Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years . Not all of Zed 's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed . \"  Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated , including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis , one tusk and the lower jaw , \"  Shaw said . \"  It will take another six to 12 months to open everything . \"  Shaw said both of Zed 's tusks were found intact , which is very rare . \"  Previously , we 've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved , \"  Shaw said . \"  It 's very exciting to us to have these two complete , beautifully preserved tusks . \"  The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum 's attendance and funding , which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession . \"  The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the ` fishbowl ' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned , \"  Shaw said . \"  So people come to see us and we 've constructed small exhibits . It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation . \"  Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year .

Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"  for the citizens of South Africa , so there could be stability within the country \"  and so the ANC movement could remain \"  stable and unified . \"  The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006 , but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him . Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma 's guilt or innocence , and he could be recharged . Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma 's popularity , particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions . Zuma has denied the charges . He said the case was politically motivated , and harmed his chances to become the ANC 's presidential nominee . He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal . He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma 's political influence to benefit his businesses .

What brought Flight AF 447 down ? \"  Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility , particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone -LRB- ITCZ -RRB- . This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge . The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ , raising its humidity and making it buoyant . Aided by the convergence of the trade winds , the buoyant air rises , releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms . The airliner 's route \"  According to CNN 's Mari Ramos , these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over . Watch more about the weather systems \"  Retired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms . \"  Because safety is the paramount concern , airliners do n't fly into storms . They fly around them , \"  he said . \"  The ITCZ is no different . Planes fly through it every day . \"  At 8 miles per minute , modern jets can easily fly around storms . Even if they encounter turbulence , they 're designed to absorb it . \"  When lightning strikes a plane , the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it , such as a wing tip . Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point , such as the tail . But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded . Unlike other aircraft where the pilot 's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders , Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"  fly by wire \"  system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces . Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning . \"  If you have a massive electrical problem it 's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces , \"  said aeronautics expert John Hansman . However , Kieran Daly , from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence , told CNN that this scenario , while not impossible , is inconceivable . \"  It 's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure , \"  he said . \"  It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure . \"  He added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system . The \"  trim tab , \"  which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder , would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely .", "9cda4be30c7605519a161ebb6f3e2c6f1d7dbaaf8": "central Athens", "6b54ba62fa3a976b3839df3e8a73b454bfbc52bd7": "Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law , or sharia , in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents .

Ohio University 's dining services can fix that , though , by allowing students ' parents to join the Birthday Club . For $ 18 , parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates , napkins , and forks they 'll need to share it with their friends . 6 .

We saw pundits , columnists , journalists , radio talk show hosts , psychologists , body language experts , entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger : Was he really sorry for committing adultery , should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles . Some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans . I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize , yet could n't articulate why it mattered so much to her , especially since she was n't his wife , kin to him , and was n't a family friend . Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete , it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams . While Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs , he has broken no laws , and what he did does n't affect us at all . Yet Williams is another matter . This week , he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14 , 2002 . Some carried his sentencing live . Yet most networks ignored his case , which ended eight years of courtroom drama . Frankly , if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes , it 's Jayson , not Tiger . Jayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court . After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career , he was a rising TV analyst with NBC , a playful man with a big heart . I 'll never forget watching him on \"  Oprah \"  with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion , how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life . But that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended . After a dinner , Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut . Williams did n't realize it was loaded , and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest . A panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi 's hand , and even jumped in his pool , hoping to wash away the evidence . Williams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup . He settled with Christofi 's family for $ 2 million , all while the case went back and forth through the legal system . While that was happening , Williams began to lose it all . His wife filed for divorce ; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter ; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself . Williams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns , a deadly combination .

Green was convicted last week in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of murder , rape , conspiracy and obstruction of justice . A jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl , then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence . Green also was found guilty of killing the girl 's parents and 6-year-old sister . Green might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court , where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light . Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed . His lawyers offered testimony Tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review \"  did not meet acceptable mental health standards . \"  Dr. Pablo Stewart testified that a military nurse-practitioner who examined Green some three months before the crimes \"  had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder . \"  Yet rather than pull Green out of combat or follow up with additional care , Stewart testified , the nurse-practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent Green back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the \"  Triangle of Death , \"  one of the bloodiest areas of the Sunni-led insurgency . Earlier , defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as Lt. Col. Karen Marrs , and she was called by the defense to testify . She described Green 's company as having the worst morale she 'd ever seen , and she said the entire battalion was \"  red , \"  meaning it was \"  mission incapable \"  -- the troops were \"  hostile , vengeful and needed increased control and command , \"  without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct . The psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty , not only to keep up troop numbers , but also because \"  soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in . \"  Marrs said procedures were followed , but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions , in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell . She said troops often were counseled that \"  having sad and angry feelings are common , \"  and that \"  you are n't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions . \"  At the time of Green 's arrest , he told FBI agents , \"  You probably think I 'm a monster . \"  Throughout the testimony Tuesday , Green repeatedly glanced at the jury .

A lawyer from Chile , he was educated there , in Spain and at Harvard Law School . Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru 's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week : the conviction of their former president , Alberto Fujimori , for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s . The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses , including the massacre of innocent civilians , and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful . It is one of the first times a nation 's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations . Equally significant , the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial , which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru 's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law . Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but , in the process of restoring order , he corrupted and weakened Peru 's most vital government institutions -- including parliament , the courts and law enforcement . Just a few years ago , Fujimori had near-total control of Peru 's judiciary . For a decade , his government used bribery , extortion , and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency , subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary , legislature , and media on government abuses . He led Peru from 1990 to 2000 , presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement . He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads . Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges . The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state . Just 20 years ago , it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book . In the late 20th century , Mao Zedong , Idi Amin , Milton Obote , Ferdinand Marcos , Anastasio Somoza , Jean-Claude \"  Baby Doc \"  Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko , to name just a few , were never brought to trial . Since then , however , the tide has turned . In October 1998 , London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes . The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet 's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere , but more important , they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice . In country after country , particularly in Latin America , victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and , often , to remain in power . Thanks to these efforts , former leaders in Argentina , and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials . Pinochet 's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda , and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished . After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the world established the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so . The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur . The Fujimori case stands out , though , because it was Peru 's national court system which demonstrated the will , capacity , and independence to try its former president .", "58df09b4ed4c8d7e16e31357a5308db8aee65c994": "Tech", "707c7ade7f791306ac9641ef29c78fc9e7cec2460": "Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Friday for a department assessment that suggested returning combat veterans could be recruited by right-wing extremist groups .

About 30 of them infect the genital tract , and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer . \"  Health for Her : Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \"  In this case , the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer . The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008 , there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives . Given those stats , this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing , right ? The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls , but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted . And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"  to give or not to give . \"  Let 's face it . Parents do n't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all . Ever . Now a new drug comes along , and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters , but it 's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients . Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26 . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12 . Ault explains why youth is key . Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted , \"  so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active , so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine . \"  Another reason to do this early , Ault points out , is that \"  our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are , say , at 22 . \"  Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and , even more important , about the realities of life , such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies . These arguments are n't convincing to some parents , the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated . There are several reasons for doing this , including religious beliefs . Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active . Others believe the drug is just too risky .

He noted that last year , for the first time , the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population . \"  What 's going on ? \"  he asked rhetorically . The panel members made clear that , whatever is going on , it is complex . Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones . At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"  some kind of relationship problem , \"  he said . Often , the situation was worsened by something else , such as a financial or legal problem , he said . And it was n't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk . The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment , those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed , Chiarelli said . All of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks . But Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene , noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need . And Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart , he said . \"  If I survey the family , I 'm going to get a different set of answers . \"  One reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions , the panel members said .

A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents ' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals . Bangkok 's outer suburbs were already submerged , but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation 's worst flooding since 1942 . In the east and the north of the city , water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods . But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats . Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok , as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction . \"  The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand , \"  a Red Cross bulletin said . Bangkok 's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate , with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water . Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage , according to the MCOT news agency . But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps , the Bangkok Post reported . Health concerns were rising with the water . Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within , the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials . The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater . \"  We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters , and every day we see children playing in the water , bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground , \"  said Annie Bodmer-Roy , spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children . As floodwater entered homes , some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave . Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city . \"  Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded , \"  said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company , which was shut after it also was flooded . \"  The water level is 2 meters -LRB- six feet -RRB- high and smells very bad , \"  she said .

Today we know better , \"  the president said . \"  These challenges share a common solution : technology . \"  \"  We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions , and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people , \"  he said . \"  We know this can be done , \"  Bush said . \"  Last year , America grew our economy while also reducing greenhouse gases . \"  If the preliminary numbers stand , it would make 2006 the first time in Bush 's presidency that greenhouse emissions dropped . In prepared remarks this week , Assistant Secretary of Energy Karen Harbert said , \"  Preliminary data for 2006 suggests an absolute reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 1.3 percent for that year despite economic growth of 2.9 percent . \"  In previous years , the administration also has said its policies were reducing greenhouse emissions , but Department of Energy figures through 2005 show emission figures went up each year .

The protocol expires in 2012 . Representatives of 16 countries , the United Nations and the European Union are attending this week 's two-day conference . The Bush administration has billed it as an initiative to develop a common approach to combat global warming following Kyoto 's collapse . At a Group of Eight conference in June , Bush pushed for a new framework on global gas emissions to counter the effects of global warming . Bush said he believes every nation should set its own goals . The president expressed concern that setting strict targets would damage the U.S. economy .

Most kidnappings are n't reported , he said , because the victims are generally smugglers , drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three . Other criminals targeted The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones . In some cases , a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment , but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom , which can be between $ 30,000 and $ 250,000 , Thompson said . \"  -LSB- The victims are -RSB- wearing the doper bling-bling , and they target them , \"  he said . \"  We 've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $ 1 million that the person has asked for . In addition to that , they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana , perhaps a pound or two of speed , a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin . \"  Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them , Burgett said . Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote 's patrons , known as pollos -LRB- Spanish for chickens -RRB- , Burgett said . Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country . See what other cities have a cartel presence There are rarely \"  true victims \"  in Phoenix 's kidnappings , the lieutenant said . However , one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"  uglier than the drug trade \"  and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes ' bidding when they ca n't come up with the ransoms . \"  In the drug business , the people getting killed are in the business . They are not end users , not consumers , \"  said Antonio Bustamente . \"  In the coyote business , the people killed are really innocent . -LSB- First-time -RSB- illegal entry is a petty offense . \"  Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix 's border-related violence , police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark . Girl mistakenly snatched On the evening of March 17 , 2008 , a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale . They were planning to play basketball . The friend , according to a police investigative report , was the niece of a man named \"  Chucky . \"  Chucky and his cohorts , witnesses told police , had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house . Hours later , the investigative report said , armed men arrived at Chucky 's sister 's house in three vehicles , one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use . The men wanted Chucky , their drugs or $ 24,000 . The 13-year-old said she did n't know Chucky . When she tried to walk away , \"  one of them grabbed her by the neck , pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle , \"  the report said . Eventually , the men called the girl 's mother to demand ransom . A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl . She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise . The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border , collateral damage is a reality . Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \"  The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence . The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him . On Andrade 's third day in captivity , an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $ 50,000 to $ 10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen . When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point , a Safeway supermarket parking lot , police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe , the report said . One of the men , Luis Alberto Castro-Vega , then 23 , disclosed Andrade 's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping . Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade 's kidnapping : first-degree burglary , theft by extortion , armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault .", "c7c83a9ee902e568a55898c616f20181952ce0579": "A \"  trap \"  is Southern slang for a drug house .", "707c7ade7f791306ac9641ef29c78fc9e7cec2467": "Rep.

Aviation fuel is carbon taxed , but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas ? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating . Punitive taxation , which is driving up the cost of air travel , will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers . This , coupled with the current economic downturn , represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development . Meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price . As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn , some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside . To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake . We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry , and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations . It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet . The 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world , something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials , and flying higher and faster than other aircraft . It 's a perfect example of a win-win solution . We burn less fuel ; our customers enjoy lower pricing . Aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed ; our fleet is based all across Europe , to reflect where our clients are . The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"  over flights \"  -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum . We wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare , one of Europe 's most experienced providers of carbon offsets , where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality . By comparison , under the European emissions trading scheme , which does n't take effect until 2012 , commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create . With the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported , people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel . While the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it , it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling . We have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit . Our competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge , which is passed on , in its entirety , to ClimateCare . By acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place , we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners . We believe that Jet Republic is at the forefront of modern European business .", "5e58a3d012de89c1c9abdcda89b5d0d6fac8748e2": "Dan Brown 's", "58df09b4ed4c8d7e16e31357a5308db8aee65c995": "Wake Forest , one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation , the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer .", "d1fbb4dc9e31dcb4bd896207a856e0819ab5a80c5": "NATO allies to provide more troops , and that he is \"  confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead .", "49feb924a7a527fb600b4338c0eaf75c3baca8715": "Daughter Britt ,", "cf7c301f613ab00d6e07dd222ab9243ef3d272a611": "It was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request , and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed .", "79b423b90af6b3381ebfa34a7382ca472bdb5b358": "desperate flight from the wreckage of President Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe is an increasingly common one .

The tale told by Average -- whose name is not unusual in Zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster . When Mugabe 's government , facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent , ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- Average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff . Facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country , he joined the estimated 4,000 Zimbabweans who head south to South Africa , most of them illegally , every day . Mugabe , 83 and in power since the country 's independence from Britain in 1980 , has been accused of running Zimbabwe 's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power . His decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world . Average scraped together his last salary , some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked , and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor 's visa and bus ticket to Johannesburg . A friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up , leaving him stranded without a place to sleep .

In a letter to President Obama , Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"  border states \"  to prevent illegal immigration . The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones , including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan . In fact , in her letter , Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective . What 's the matter with Arizona ? Is n't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke ? I guess this is par for the course . Brewer just signed SB 1070 , a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law , to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent . Why should n't she get the chance to suit up and play general ? After all , like the United States , Arizona is currently involved in two wars . There 's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans would n't do . And then there 's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration , which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration , which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands . The argument that the federal government is n't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless . It is dishonest because it 's not true . I 've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years : in Texas , Arizona and California . I 've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors . I 've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border , which offers a unique perspective on border security . So I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you : The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified . There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll . That 's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip . In fact , it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office . It is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge , as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law . And that 's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado . In fact , it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they 're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement , since that 's a no-no under the Constitution . If the federal government does take border enforcement seriously , critics might ask : Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally ? Simple . We can dig a moat , deploy an army , build walls or call in an airstrike , but desperate people will always find a way to go around , under or over any impediment in their path to a better life . This is n't to condone illegal immigration . My views -- in support of deportations , workplace raids , giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known . I 'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me : that it does n't make any sense to focus all our attention at the border while turning a blind eye to employers in the interior . That 's like trying to fill a bucket with teaspoons of water without first plugging the hole at the bottom . Now Obama has fallen into that same trap . He is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence .", "fff567e27b2f96f9112aef4b454712b5f568ef9f6": "Hogan", "6b4e6434de8d5cf8e1967f1f0c1013f943be0d014": "133 people in 26", "1ebb68c2d8f7f4cc85a3454c7b57bb79f10357c93": "Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71 , and visited the city on several other occasions , in order to depict its buildings through the then-famous fog .", "ecd3f13be2b7e4311cfb6cfe1abef14a7d5561b13": "The Turkish government said rainfall over its part of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers plummeted by about 46 percent in the past three years .

It was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy 's 1977 solo albums , \"  The Idiot \"  and \"  Lust for Life . \"  The latter included the songs \"  The Passenger \"  and \"  Lust for Life , \"  which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks , spawning countless cover versions . More commercial than The Stooges ' records , Iggy 's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales , but never breakthrough into the mainstream . Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums , with \"  China Girl \"  becoming a hit single for Bowie . Iggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s , without much commercial success , although the single \"  Real Wild Child \"  was a hit in the U.S. and UK . But by the end of the decade , Iggy was beginning to be recognized as \"  the Godfather of Punk , \"  with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence .", "3d1090ed32b442c478f4f775ca76080839baa88e1": "Robert Barnett", "b6dc93602bbb9ce10b5f7360868b906cb93bf6180": "Thirteen people were killed and 90 wounded in clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Cairo , state-run Egyptian television reported Wednesday .

Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur . Vasundhara Raje , chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \"  unnamed international terror group \"  for the attack , but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one . H.G. Ragavendhra , Jaipur 's superintendent of police , told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . Jaipur , known as the \"  pink city \"  for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population . The day-long curfew , authorities said , was meant to prevent \"  communal violence . \"  It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal . Also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami -LRB- HuJi -RRB- of being behind the attacks , according to CNN 's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India . No one has claimed responsibility . In the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"  foreign \"  Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir . It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan . Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan . Both control parts of the region , which is predominantly Muslim . Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . See the aftermath of the explosions . \"  Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan . She also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . Furthermore , Raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . On Tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur 's walled city . The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -LRB- 0.3 miles -RRB- of each other . Police defused a ninth bomb . The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India 's financial capital , Mumbai . In July 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai , formerly Bombay . In that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . Both attacks used RDX , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays . The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman , the Hindu monkey king . Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . In the Mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . Indian officials blamed Pakistan 's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , for the attack . Pakistan , which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . Just as on Tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006 .", "1214c6f407f390304f0d6e71b377cecbf35c533e6": "Chinese", "b8b5ea3238e180f7726f12c821a4b4aad9f1495d4": "Sri Lanka 's president declared Wednesday that the country 's Tamil insurgents are on the verge of total defeat , saying their demise has helped unite the island nation on the 61st anniversary of its independence .

Crime scene evidence was destroyed , they say . A bloody hand print was not analyzed . Transcripts from the trial vanished . Frank 's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor , Jim Conley , who most came to see as Phagan 's killer . He 'd written notes found with the body , but said they were dictated to him . The prosecutor , Hugh Dorsey , used race in his argument , saying a black man could n't be smart enough to come up with such stories . Witnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt . Conley 's own attorney , William Smith , came to believe in Frank 's innocence , scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later . Conley , who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years , eventually disappeared . Dorsey , the prosecutor , had political aspirations riding on this win . \"  A conviction of just another black guy was n't going to do anything for his career , \"  said Sandy Berman , the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit , \"  Seeking Justice : The Leo Frank Case Revisited . \"  Two years after Frank 's lynching , Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia . But the story was interpreted differently by Kean , who wrote \"  The Murder of Little Mary Phagan , \"  and stands by this conclusion : \"  Leo Frank was guilty as sin . He was a sexual pervert . \"  Kean often visits her namesake 's grave in Marietta . She 's not the only one . She says she 's struck by the teddy bears people leave there . The governor Elizabeth Slaton Wallace could n't be prouder of her heritage . At 81 , she 's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton , the man who commuted Frank 's death sentence to a life sentence , believing Frank 's innocence would be proved and , in doing so , ruined his political career . The Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton . Frank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville , Georgia , where an inmate slashed his throat . He survived , but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison , with no resistance from officials , and abducted Frank in the dark of night . By dawn , he was hanging from a tree in Marietta . Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards . \"  Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that . He was railroaded . Uncle Jack knew that , \"  said Wallace , who lives in Atlanta . She ca n't explain why the story persists to this day . But throughout her life she 's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community , especially toward her father , who was named for the late governor . \"  The Jewish community could never do enough for my father , \"  said Wallace , who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s . \"  They could have given us the shop . \"  As grateful as they were to Slaton , Frank 's lynching left Georgia 's small Jewish community frightened . Many left the state ; those who stayed kept a low profile . For decades , they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones . The lynching party The lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South . But this case , the only lynching of a Jew on American soil , was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy , historians say . While Georgia Jews remained quiet , so did those who were involved in Frank 's killing , said Steve Oney of Los Angeles , California , who wrote the authoritative book \"  And the Dead Shall Rise : The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank . \"  It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly , and not just secretly , known . \"  They were not liquored-up yahoos , \"  said Oney , a journalist , editor and Atlanta", "33f0310d73bc0bdfe801ca375e0986b8ddce0fea2": "Prime Minister Benjamin", "6556c64821ece8123c130b27285efe9619c3c7fd4": "significant restrictions on war", "fed968c89cc8bfd3eaf6b307bc8d515a86f6cc014": "very productive meeting of the minds . \"  She said both Lavrov and she are \"  very practical-minded \"  and will create a \"  specific set of objectives and responsibilities \"  to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders ' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London .", "b84b5293335b7719e25ec0249b13ebce604bad9e6": "League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan", "ebc4c8962079c28f1e94c3d80019a0ad324c14e95": "found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted .

The bill would also make mandatory jobs skills training for every service member moving into civilian life and also offer older veterans additional Montgomery GI benefits for training programs at community colleges and technical schools . \"  It is quite frankly shameful that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a higher unemployment rate than the rest of America , \"  said Sen.

Jenny Sanford , unlike so many wives of cheating politicians , was not there facing the cameras , standing beside her husband . A reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated . \"  I 'm here , and she 's there , \"  he replied . As romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday , the state 's first lady , a former Wall Street executive , stayed far away from reporters .

I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago . \"  This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage .

CNN : Everyone knows of your success with \"  Wicked \"  -- it 's huge . But what was your life like before you wrote that book ? Maguire : I had written children 's books for 14 years before I published \"  Wicked . \"  And none of them were poorly reviewed , and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed .

And are they good enough , are they strong enough , standards by which to live ? CNN : You talked about writing children 's books . How is writing for children different than writing for adults ? Maguire : Well , for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults . So you have to start out active , you have to start out strong and you can not be , for a moment , self-indulgent .

So given this background , you might understand why , when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls , I was braced for a fight . Oddly enough , for once , the battle did n't come . I told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV -LRB- human papillomavirus -RRB- vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor . \"  I do n't want to . \"  \"  Well , sorry . You have to . \"  \"  I heard it hurts . \"  \"  Well , that 's too bad . But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life . \"  \"  Oh . -LRB- pause -RRB- OK . \"  If you were keeping score , you might chalk that one up as a Mom win . The only problem with that is after winning over my daughter , I now had to convince myself . This drug has its own emotional battlefields . The HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years . When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil , many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug . Dr. Kevin Ault , associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University 's School of Medicine , says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments , some not too serious , but others that are potentially deadly . \"  There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus , \"  he said . \"  Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous , like plantar warts or warts on your hand . About 30 of them infect the genital tract , and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer . \"  Health for Her : Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \"  In this case , the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer . The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008 , there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives . Given those stats , this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing , right ? The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls , but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted . And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"  to give or not to give . \"  Let 's face it . Parents do n't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all . Ever . Now a new drug comes along , and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters , but it 's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients . Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26 . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12 . Ault explains why youth is key . Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted , \"  so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active , so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine . \"  Another reason to do this early , Ault points out , is that \"  our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are , say , at 22 . \"  Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and , even more important , about the realities of life , such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies . These arguments are n't convincing to some parents , the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated . There are several reasons for doing this , including religious beliefs . Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active . Others believe the drug is just too risky . CDC spokesman Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC / FDA hotline . Parents , patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , or VAERS , to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine . Through a Freedom of Information Act petition , the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who 'd had the vaccine in March-April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007 . All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine . Allen cautions restraint in considering the reports . \"  Most of these reactions were minor , \"  he said , and the deaths \"  were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine . \"  The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and wo n't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV", "551839469c1133ef4697ed435c5de192e60768581": "McCartney said the early Beatles knew they were a good band and were pretty sure of themselves , but Starr said , \"  We thought we 'd be really big in Liverpool . \"  \"  I think the most exciting thing is that , you know , we expect people our age to know the music .

He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator , filing it around 1 p.m. , the spokeswoman said . The Interior Ministry , which had 72 hours to reply to the request , was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter .

Early Tuesday , the river level stood at 27.6 feet , according to the National Weather Service . Flood stage is 18 feet , according to the service . \"  We thought we had a couple more weeks , and with the weather and the quick thaw and the rains we 've had recently , it 's really made it more difficult and it 's really sped up the crest , \"  Fargo police Sgt. Carlos Nestler said . Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river 's edge . Fargo 's Kurt Kaye is doing what he did last year , helping friends protect their home from the rising Red River , which runs through their backyard . Like most residents , he said he 's resolved to keep the water at bay . \"  I think everyone is a little tired of it , but they 'll get behind it and go , \"  he said . \"  They need to get it done to save their houses . \"  Zavoral , the city administrator , said Fargo is better prepared this year to deal with a major flood . \"  We 've spent about $ 10 million putting in permanent flood protection in some of the neighborhoods and bought out about 26 homes in the low-lying areas , \"  he said . City officials have said they believe they 'll need about 1 million fewer sandbags than were used last year . Is severe weather happening near you ?

The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the \"  black box \"  warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones , and also to warn doctors . Earlier this year , Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions . Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"  pleased \"  with the FDA 's order but added \"  there is still more that the FDA must do . \"  \"  The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions , such as tendon pain , so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture , \"  the group said . \"  We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures . \"  When asked about the lawsuit and why it did n't order the \"  black box \"  label warning until now , Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004 , and updated the information last year .

Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. , which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox , said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as \"  well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications . \"  Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer . Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals , which markets Levaquin in the United States , also said it would abide by the FDA 's request . Merck & Co. , the maker of Noroxin , said it , too , would update the drug 's label . But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form . Oscient Pharmaceuticals -LRB- Factive -RRB- , Daiichi Sankyo -LRB- Floxin -RRB- and Dipomed -LRB- Proquin -RRB- did not immediately respond to CNN 's requests for comment .

Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon . \"  Sometimes it 's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning , \"  she said . Normally , she added , that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"  a week or two before the patient will rupture . \"  Public Citizen , founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader , said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007 . \"  Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA , the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher , \"  the group said . The FDA would only say that it has received \"  hundreds \"  of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones , without being more specific , citing the ongoing lawsuit .

On Tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur 's walled city . The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -LRB- 0.3 miles -RRB- of each other . Police defused a ninth bomb . The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India 's financial capital , Mumbai . In July 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai , formerly Bombay . In that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . Both attacks used RDX , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays . The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman , the Hindu monkey king . Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . In the Mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . Indian officials blamed Pakistan 's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , for the attack . Pakistan , which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . Just as on Tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006 .", "64e309025dfcedc2ab9b47ac1957d49dd58cdb776": "Woods crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and then a tree just a few days after the National Enquirer reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess who denied the affair .

Jindal received negative reviews after the speech , and Larry asked him how he felt about that . They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh . The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity : Larry King : Governor , you took a lot of flak for that speech . Were you surprised that you did ? Gov. Bobby Jindal : Let 's be clear , the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we 've seen in a generation . I 'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is . And I 'm not the only one that 's got that opinion . I hope people look at the content of the speech , not just the delivery . You know , for years , I 've been told I speak too quickly . Now I 'm told I speak too slowly . What 's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package , with the leadership in Congress , with the administration . I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again . We need to put more money in the private sector . Watch Larry King 's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2 \"  Let 's cut taxes . Let 's get rid of the wasteful spending . That 's the debate . That 's the discussion we need to be having . King : But governor , to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis , when in some cases , they are the only answer , that pointed to a lot of the criticism , did n't it ? Jindal : If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described , I think you 'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support . We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway . Less than 5 percent of this bill was actually -LSB- for -RSB- the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described . ... Fundamentally , I do n't think $ 30 million for the federal government to buy new cars , $ 1 billion for the Census , $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs . King : There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry . No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit . Jindal : Well , Larry , I think that you 're absolutely right . One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party did n't match its actions with its rhetoric . ... I think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture . The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side . King : Governor , if perception is reality , do you think your speech hurt the party ? Jindal : I think that people are going to look at the content . I think people are going to be focused now that we 've -LSB- got -RSB- alternative views on how to move our country forward . Let me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get . Whenever we can find areas of agreement , we need to work across the aisle and put America first . But when we disagree , we need to offer principled alternative solutions . So for example , in health care , I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American . I just do n't think it should be a government-run program . King : All right , governor , here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend 's CPAC Conference . Watch .

Long troop deployments in Iraq , above , and Afghanistan have been cited in the rise in military suicides . \"  We must find ways to relieve some of this stress , \"  said Gen. Peter W.

He cited long deployments , lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides . Adm. Patrick M.

Gen. James F. Amos , assistant commandant of the Marine Corps , said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention \"  at all levels . \"  He said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines .

He noted that last year , for the first time , the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population . \"  What 's going on ? \"  he asked rhetorically . The panel members made clear that , whatever is going on , it is complex . Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones . At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"  some kind of relationship problem , \"  he said . Often , the situation was worsened by something else , such as a financial or legal problem , he said .

The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment , those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed , Chiarelli said .

And others call civilian hotlines , one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel . Representatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides . At the Pentagon , Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"  were a real strain \"  on many , but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works . \"  All the services are are addressing this problem , but the Army in particular , I think , is really going after it in a very aggressive way , \"  he said . But some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts . Maj. Gen. David A. Rubenstein , deputy surgeon general of the Army , cited the case of a 33-year-old soldier who was living at home with his wife and three children . He suffered a traumatic brain injury more than two years ago and had been giving weekly motivational speeches to other soldiers in a clinic . For the past two years , the soldier also had been seeing a psychiatrist . The most recent visit occurred last Friday .

A common but mysterious condition One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy , and some will outgrow their sensitivities , said Anne Munoz-Furlong , founder and CEO of FAAN . But allergies to peanuts , nuts , shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong , she said . As far as she knows , Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind . Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise , but no one is sure why . Research on food allergies has been slow because \"  for a long time , people thought this was a small problem , \"  Munoz-Furlong said . The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress , including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies , she said . The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"  cyclic , \"  with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies : sneezing , itchy eyes , and nasal congestion , said Dr. Alpen Patel , assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University . Other people experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods . But for some people , ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis , a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways , cardiovascular collapse , and even death . This is called a \"  fixed food allergy , \"  he said . After one severe reaction , he said , most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack . But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis . Enjoying food in spite of allergies Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals , whether at Thanksgiving or on a date , without feeling sick . She runs her own coaching practice , blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc. . She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow 's milk , and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts . She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon , lemon grass , eggplant , some types of melons and most tropical fruits . But Miller , now 36 , did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants . She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs , and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems . \"  It is both worry-free for the diner and worry-free for the restaurant , \"  she said . \"  Restaurants appreciate that I 'm looking out for them as well ... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time . \"  Where everybody knows your name So how does someone like Miller , who lives with food allergies plus a \"  wheat/gluten-free , processed sugar-free , lactose-free , soy-free , low processed food-free lifestyle , \"  safely enjoy eating out ? Miller calls it the \"  Cheers \"  experience . The first time she goes to a restaurant , she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation . Once at the restaurant , she 'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs . Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu . By this point , Miller says , everyone has been introduced by name . After the meal , Miller thanks the server , chef and manager , and tips the server generously . She 'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely .", "e1de8533e75800f7294700ad7d7f77416b84648411": "Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan 's North West Frontier", "11f98941a56820775d6e8e2424966ba6431f59502": "it 's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it .", "c9a8fd1367f993937b0fb2af2f82a9be1dc317d04": "Interior Ministry officials said that a U.S. helicopter crashed in northeastern Baghdad as a result of clashes between U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and gunmen .", "05206bbad78711862f6fc429837ce2e7bd74dbd21": "Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that , after months of flooding , 107,101", "9c9b7e1831ea54995442f47080dae9faa8d07c1e5": "Felipe Massa and Fernando", "092b1785f7cbefbf8e5601ba3b44ff3240847a390": "Miami Beach", "e447c04c719f9bd8d9f95e24bcf6abf222969cf55": "H\u00f6rnumer", "c4c04273b8e4204fabdf16580d41fdaa19d759bf0": "Alikhail said .

They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh . The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity : Larry King : Governor , you took a lot of flak for that speech . Were you surprised that you did ? Gov. Bobby Jindal : Let 's be clear , the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we 've seen in a generation . I 'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is . And I 'm not the only one that 's got that opinion . I hope people look at the content of the speech , not just the delivery . You know , for years , I 've been told I speak too quickly . Now I 'm told I speak too slowly . What 's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package , with the leadership in Congress , with the administration . I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again . We need to put more money in the private sector . Watch Larry King 's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2 \"  Let 's cut taxes . Let 's get rid of the wasteful spending . That 's the debate . That 's the discussion we need to be having . King : But governor , to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis , when in some cases , they are the only answer , that pointed to a lot of the criticism , did n't it ? Jindal : If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described , I think you 'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support . We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway . Less than 5 percent of this bill was actually -LSB- for -RSB- the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described . ... Fundamentally , I do n't think $ 30 million for the federal government to buy new cars , $ 1 billion for the Census , $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs . King : There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry . No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit . Jindal : Well , Larry , I think that you 're absolutely right . One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party did n't match its actions with its rhetoric . ... I think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture . The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side . King : Governor , if perception is reality , do you think your speech hurt the party ? Jindal : I think that people are going to look at the content . I think people are going to be focused now that we 've -LSB- got -RSB- alternative views on how to move our country forward . Let me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get . Whenever we can find areas of agreement , we need to work across the aisle and put America first . But when we disagree , we need to offer principled alternative solutions . So for example , in health care , I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American . I just do n't think it should be a government-run program . King : All right , governor , here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend 's CPAC Conference . Watch . Rush Limbaugh : What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ? Why would I want that to succeed ? King : Governor , do you think people are thinking about capitalism now or are they thinking about problems ? Jindal : Look , clearly , the American people are worried about paying their mortgages , keeping their jobs and paying their health care bills . I think Rush is a great leader for conservatives . I think he articulates what a lot of people are concerned about . King : Do you want him -LSB- Obama -RSB- to fail ? Jindal : I do n't want those policies to be adopted . I want my country to succeed , but I do n't want policies to be adopted . King : What if the policies work ? Jindal : Well , again ... King : What if they work ? Jindal : This is where we have a fundamental disagreement . I do n't think it 's going work ... to spend in excess of our revenues . I want my country to succeed . But what I worry about is that simply spending money on new programs . Look at every new bailout . You talked about the auto bailouts . Then you had the fourth , I think it 's the fourth -- it 's hard to keep track -- AIG bailout today . It seems like every time you turn around , there 's another trillion dollar plan . King : One more thing . It may be moot now , but RNC Chairman Michael Steele took some shots at Limbaugh and then apologized . What do you make of all of that ? Jindal : Well , I did n't follow the day 's events . I 'm glad he apologized . I think the chairman is a breath of fresh air for the party . As I said before , I think Rush is a leader for many conservatives and says things that people are concerned about . -LSB- He -RSB- articulates very well the concern people have about growing government spending without an end in sight .", "8aadb893d14517b73094c193921e4ffb2a47fbb94": "16 GB Kindle", "4c7194406223a0020f44aa0c63c3f5d47937c88b0": "first charter school to reopen in New Orleans ' Ninth Ward , the hardest-hit portion of the city .", "95de1a83db8617658b4f0cbbdd5d9aeb1a7dbf5f5": "Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha .", "2f482e021caf07e2f07baf111c36d1587758f1883": "Police imposed a curfew in Jaipur on Wednesday , a day after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the ancient Indian city killed at least 63 people and wounded more than 200 . Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur . Vasundhara Raje , chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \"  unnamed international terror group \"  for the attack , but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one . H.G. Ragavendhra , Jaipur 's superintendent of police , told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . Jaipur , known as the \"  pink city \"  for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population . The day-long curfew , authorities said , was meant to prevent \"  communal violence . \"  It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal . Also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami -LRB- HuJi -RRB- of being behind the attacks , according to CNN 's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India . No one has claimed responsibility . In the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"  foreign \"  Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir . It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan . Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan . Both control parts of the region , which is predominantly Muslim . Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . See the aftermath of the explosions . \"  Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan . She also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . Furthermore , Raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . On Tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur 's walled city . The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -LRB- 0.3 miles -RRB- of each other . Police defused a ninth bomb . The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India 's financial capital , Mumbai . In July 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai , formerly Bombay . In that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . Both attacks used RDX , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays . The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman , the Hindu monkey king . Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . In the Mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . Indian officials blamed Pakistan 's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , for the attack . Pakistan , which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . Just as on Tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006 . At least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion , which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers . That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba . Authorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks .

Crime scene evidence was destroyed , they say . A bloody hand print was not analyzed . Transcripts from the trial vanished . Frank 's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor , Jim Conley , who most came to see as Phagan 's killer . He 'd written notes found with the body , but said they were dictated to him . The prosecutor , Hugh Dorsey , used race in his argument , saying a black man could n't be smart enough to come up with such stories . Witnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt . Conley 's own attorney , William Smith , came to believe in Frank 's innocence , scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later . Conley , who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years , eventually disappeared . Dorsey , the prosecutor , had political aspirations riding on this win . \"  A conviction of just another black guy was n't going to do anything for his career , \"  said Sandy Berman , the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit , \"  Seeking Justice : The Leo Frank Case Revisited . \"  Two years after Frank 's lynching , Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia . But the story was interpreted differently by Kean , who wrote \"  The Murder of Little Mary Phagan , \"  and stands by this conclusion : \"  Leo Frank was guilty as sin . He was a sexual pervert . \"  Kean often visits her namesake 's grave in Marietta . She 's not the only one . She says she 's struck by the teddy bears people leave there . The governor Elizabeth Slaton Wallace could n't be prouder of her heritage . At 81 , she 's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton , the man who commuted Frank 's death sentence to a life sentence , believing Frank 's innocence would be proved and , in doing so , ruined his political career . The Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton . Frank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville , Georgia , where an inmate slashed his throat . He survived , but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison , with no resistance from officials , and abducted Frank in the dark of night . By dawn , he was hanging from a tree in Marietta . Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards . \"  Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that . He was railroaded . Uncle Jack knew that , \"  said Wallace , who lives in Atlanta . She ca n't explain why the story persists to this day . But throughout her life she 's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community , especially toward her father , who was named for the late governor . \"  The Jewish community could never do enough for my father , \"  said Wallace , who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s . \"  They could have given us the shop . \"  As grateful as they were to Slaton , Frank 's lynching left Georgia 's small Jewish community frightened . Many left the state ; those who stayed kept a low profile . For decades , they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones . The lynching party The lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South . But this case , the only lynching of a Jew on American soil , was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy , historians say . While Georgia Jews remained quiet , so did those who were involved in Frank 's killing , said Steve Oney of Los Angeles , California , who wrote the authoritative book \"  And the Dead Shall Rise : The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank . \"  It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly , and not just secretly , known . \"  They were not liquored-up yahoos , \"  said Oney , a journalist , editor and Atlanta", "ae8e756e2e91fbbbf0d720cc17db980e812a5c7011": "A bus carrying Chinese tourists overturned Friday near Hoover Dam , killing at least seven people and injuring at least nine , an Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman said .

Octavia Nasr , CNN senior editor for the Middle East who monitors social media sites , said young people are boldly circumventing the official media censorship across the Middle East with Twitter , Facebook and alternatives . \"  People are taking matters into their own hands , \"  Nasr said . \"  Traditional media is not necessarily a driving force . \"  Azza Matar , translator at the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information in Cairo , Egypt , said governments want the Arab world to use the Internet for fun and not interfere with government and serious issues , but people are circumventing the officials with new media . \"  We 're trying to express ourselves and expose the lies , \"  she said . People from different countries prefer different kinds of new media , she said . As for Iranians , who are gearing up for a day of protests Thursday against the regime on the Islamic Revolution 's anniversary , she said Iranians prefer Twitter because it ca n't be blocked and \"  is faster than blogs in conveying messages for masses . \"  Neziha Rejiba , vice president of the Tunis-based Observatory for the Freedom of Press , Publishing and Creation and editor at Kalima Radio , said that theoretically , the whole world is getting its information online , but in the Middle East , censorship remains a reality , with cyberpolice blocking sites or even , as in the case of Syria , the Internet itself . There is a dynamic in the Middle East between censorship and self-censorship . \"  When journalists sit down to write a piece , they have to keep in mind the reaction to what they 're writing . They 're either scared of sanctions or revenge . \"  Bahrain 's Foreign Minister Khalid Al Khalifa said the Internet \"  has revolutionized the world \"  and \"  has helped foster creativity , innovation and freedom . \"  There have been complaints there about the recent blocking of Web sites in Bahrain . While Al Khalifa said regulating different kinds of censorship internationally is impractical , he said in the Middle East , censorship takes forms he has mixed feelings about . \"  Censorship can be taken too far to silence dissent and opposing views , but it can also be used as a tool to prevent potentially destructive and damaging ideas and behavior . There is increasing concern about harmful content on the Internet from violence , inciting racial hatred and terrorist activity , to sexual content and pornography , which justifies censorship on moral grounds , \"  Al Khalifa said . As for other aspects of the Middle East and its media , the report reveals several relative silver linings when it comes to press freedom : the environment in Lebanon , Israel and the United Arab Emirates . Lebanon has a \"  far and more diverse and vibrant media than any other Arab country , \"  but the institute found that \"  most of Lebanon 's media outlets are unduly influenced in their journalism content by powerful political figures to whom they are financially and politically beholden . \"  Mills said the media in Lebanon can be characterized as \"  partly free \"  because there 's a lot they do n't talk about , such as criticism of military intelligence and the head of state , for example .

U.S. President Barack Obama called Monday for a \"  new chapter \"  of improved governance in Afghanistan now that Karzai 's re-election as president is complete . Observers say Karzai 's real test will be whether he can form a government that is seen as legitimate in the eyes of the Afghan people and the international community . Afghanistan 's Independent Electoral Commission announced Karzai 's victory Monday after it canceled Saturday 's presidential runoff because of the withdrawal of candidate Abdullah Abdullah . A runoff could have been held with just one candidate , but commission president Azizullah Lodin said electoral officials decided to cancel the second round of voting for several reasons , including security and money . The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement , according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai . Afghans went to the polls on August 20 , in a vote marred by widespread fraud . Karzai had initially claimed victory , but two months after the vote , a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes , citing fraud . That left Karzai short of a majority , and he eventually agreed to the runoff . Abdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff . He argued that the commissioners , who are hired by Karzai , can not be impartial . But that request was not met , Abdullah said Sunday , and he did not believe a transparent election was possible . \"  I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people , \"  Abdullah told reporters . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Kabul on Monday hours before the commission 's announcement . He issued a statement welcoming the decision , congratulating Karzai , and restating the U.N. 's commitment to supporting the new government . \"  This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned , \"  Ban said in the statement . \"  Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community . \"  On Monday , Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah , as well as U.N. officials , including Kai Eide , head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan . The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission 's decision and congratulating Karzai . In Washington , President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation . \"  Although the process was messy , I 'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law , \"  Obama said . He said he told Karzai \"  that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance , a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption , joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security . \"  Obama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment , \"  but as I indicated to him , the proof is not going to be in words , it 's going to be in deeds . \"  Despite the resolved election issue , Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan .

CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for . He reassured Muslims in America that \"  We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers . \"  For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign , this signaled a welcome change . Even more important was his subsequent statement : \"  To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . \"  In traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years , I heard several anti-American comments ; these Europeans were challenging me , a Muslim , about American foreign policy in Palestine , Iraq and Afghanistan . In Muslim countries , I 've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America , followed by accusations that , \"  your President Bush does n't like us Muslims . \"  As a Muslim-American , I have found myself in a difficult position . In America , I 've had to explain Islam to other Americans , and abroad , I 've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world . Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world . For me personally , it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims . And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions . In his first steps as president , Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison , called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process , as special envoy for the Middle East . For the past few weeks , I 've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama 's recent actions . Obama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not : Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world .", "84bdf4904837039945fdffa37aad599154725f3b6": "that less than", "3d1090ed32b442c478f4f775ca76080839baa88e7": "Robert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton . CNN : How does Tuesday night 's town hall format differ from other debates ? Barnett : The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would . So , for example , one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341 , but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation . And so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question , because if you do n't , you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners .

The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses , including the massacre of innocent civilians , and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful . It is one of the first times a nation 's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations . Equally significant , the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial , which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru 's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law . Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but , in the process of restoring order , he corrupted and weakened Peru 's most vital government institutions -- including parliament , the courts and law enforcement . Just a few years ago , Fujimori had near-total control of Peru 's judiciary . For a decade , his government used bribery , extortion , and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency , subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary , legislature , and media on government abuses . He led Peru from 1990 to 2000 , presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement . He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads . Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges . The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state . Just 20 years ago , it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book . In the late 20th century , Mao Zedong , Idi Amin , Milton Obote , Ferdinand Marcos , Anastasio Somoza , Jean-Claude \"  Baby Doc \"  Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko , to name just a few , were never brought to trial . Since then , however , the tide has turned . In October 1998 , London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes . The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet 's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere , but more important , they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice . In country after country , particularly in Latin America , victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and , often , to remain in power . Thanks to these efforts , former leaders in Argentina , and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials . Pinochet 's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda , and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished . After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the world established the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so . The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur .", "58886139cfc52156248ff38816eb87b1a589da815": "September 17 ,", "2abf786570b9f9de945c70d9678cb67dd2a2e57e4": "Navarro", "33afb8dc74a6a3c9661a6e190693706c5daa6de82": "Germany 's Ore", "0eda7f6fbe2ef1b7802b304631c67c4e1501e4bf7": "$ 50,000 for", "d71483096a5c373224dbd9e0ea3a498e288301a05": "Work extra-hard at your job and get a promotion .", "769084f224ed8d05a4f689070eb0bd1cca1f19320": "Almighty and come home .", "ca5c0c816376354b82a4a7b9fa9a31b655e2d2cd6": "Hamlin", "b3995561405141185ab01e410eb751318324e97a8": "Joe", "95841efd77f244db5fce3bd2a5e43e5b825923ca5": "Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman .

Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur . Vasundhara Raje , chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \"  unnamed international terror group \"  for the attack , but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one . H.G. Ragavendhra , Jaipur 's superintendent of police , told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . Jaipur , known as the \"  pink city \"  for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population . The day-long curfew , authorities said , was meant to prevent \"  communal violence . \"  It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal . Also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami -LRB- HuJi -RRB- of being behind the attacks , according to CNN 's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India . No one has claimed responsibility . In the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"  foreign \"  Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir . It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan . Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan . Both control parts of the region , which is predominantly Muslim . Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . See the aftermath of the explosions . \"  Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan . She also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . Furthermore , Raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . On Tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur 's walled city . The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -LRB- 0.3 miles -RRB- of each other . Police defused a ninth bomb . The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India 's financial capital , Mumbai . In July 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai , formerly Bombay . In that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . Both attacks used RDX , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays . The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman , the Hindu monkey king . Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . In the Mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . Indian officials blamed Pakistan 's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , for the attack . Pakistan , which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . Just as on Tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006 .", "91eb6b7e6651707dcf2e6570bb9df64084a9a0d04": "television show which looks at how children as young as eight would cope without their parents for two weeks .", "1d77d0687a32e8147f87d0f97cb7224266036b565": "2,800 Canadian", "a248472dec3af8292ae0d3333b197b042f051b402": "1975", "6d8085c522c68510f5092b2804a0668d978f283e4": "The judge in the federal trial of alleged \"  underwear bomber \"  Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab refused Tuesday to prevent the prosecution from calling the device he allegedly carried a \"  bomb .", "92fe95a8e829a7eb7be8780cb9f3ad6f5f848d543": "137", "79b423b90af6b3381ebfa34a7382ca472bdb5b359": "Mugabe 's government , facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent , ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- Average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff .", "58886139cfc52156248ff38816eb87b1a589da813": "lithium deficiency disease \"  and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect .", "d90ad1ad9c5febad5ea91e1022a19d12ee5d575b2": "It 's a collection of essays from influential types intended to encourage readers to get involved in service and volunteerism in their communities .", "dc804f5062703c3d47ace08fe32a29466fded30f6": "points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a \"  concert , party , meeting or event .", "4ebd379bc7a91c5f851cf0da1a6947d1afafa0fc0": "Ismail Haniya .", "abd2359f967a76bef0a7d8ae97f9da7d898265d51": "Carrillo Leyva \"  is considered one of the heirs to the criminal organization known as the Juarez Cartel , after the death of his father , Amado Carrillo Fuentes , \"  said Assistant Prosecutor Maricela Morales .

The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage . Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh . The rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder . The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past . But Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom . Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired . Unfortunately , finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey . Today , most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety . Glass-walled office suites are the norm , insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view . The world of \"  Mad Men 's \"  Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past . Today 's sexual harassment is far more subtle . Although legitimate claims deserve compensation , the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside . False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders . Employment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment . They want their reputations and integrity preserved . But when a high-ranking executive is involved , the company rumor vine begins to grow . Depositions are taken . Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other . Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts . And of course , the litigation process is expensive for the company . Knowing this , experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit .

Mark Fields , executive vice president of Ford , spoke to CNN 's Kiran Chetry Tuesday on \"  American Morning \"  about the company 's plans and whether it will be able to continue without financial aid from the government . Kiran Chetry : So , Mark , your company is the one that 's gotten by without federal money . Will you be able to continue that ? Mark Fields : Well , our position has n't changed . We 're in a different position than some of our competitors , and we 're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance . Chetry : Right , but I 'm saying in the future , how are you guys guaranteeing that you wo n't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help ? Fields : Well , we 're going to continue executing our plan , which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business , but also bringing great high-quality , fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace . And we 've been working this plan over the last three years , and we 've been making progress . Clearly it 's a tough time in the economy , but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers , getting our cost structure right . We 've come to new agreements with our UAW partners . We 're working through reducing our debt . So we 're going to continue working through that , and we do n't expect to take taxpayer assistance from the emergency funds . Watch Fields discuss Ford 's future \"  Chetry : You say it 's been tough times , and certainly for you guys , it has -- 2008 the worst annual loss in Ford 's 105-year history . You guys can restructure . You can work out new deals with the unions . But in the end , if people are n't buying cars or they ca n't get credit , how do you remain viable ? Fields : Well , consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now . The good news is , our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received . Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months . We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again . But getting that consumer confidence is really important . And that 's why today we 're announcing our Ford advantage plan , and it 's for any customer who buys a Ford , Lincoln or Mercury product , when they come into the showroom and buy their product , if that customer loses their position , we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they 're unemployed , to give them that peace of mind . Post your comments on AMfix Chetry : You 're also offering some zero percent financing . I 'm sure that you 're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances . I want to get your take on this , though . President Obama announced yesterday he 's giving ... Chrysler a month , basically , to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable . The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out . Was that the right move , in your opinion ? Fields : Well , what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry . As we mentioned , Ford is in a different position . We 're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance . But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business , but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we 're going -- we 're coming out with over the next couple of months . Chetry : You know , there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors . They 're getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money .

We saw pundits , columnists , journalists , radio talk show hosts , psychologists , body language experts , entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger : Was he really sorry for committing adultery , should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles . Some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans . I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize , yet could n't articulate why it mattered so much to her , especially since she was n't his wife , kin to him , and was n't a family friend . Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete , it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams . While Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs , he has broken no laws , and what he did does n't affect us at all . Yet Williams is another matter . This week , he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14 , 2002 . Some carried his sentencing live . Yet most networks ignored his case , which ended eight years of courtroom drama . Frankly , if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes , it 's Jayson , not Tiger . Jayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court . After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career , he was a rising TV analyst with NBC , a playful man with a big heart . I 'll never forget watching him on \"  Oprah \"  with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion , how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life . But that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended . After a dinner , Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut . Williams did n't realize it was loaded , and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest . A panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi 's hand , and even jumped in his pool , hoping to wash away the evidence . Williams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup . He settled with Christofi 's family for $ 2 million , all while the case went back and forth through the legal system . While that was happening , Williams began to lose it all . His wife filed for divorce ; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter ; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself . Williams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns , a deadly combination .

His replacement , African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe , will be sworn in as South Africa 's president Thursday . Mbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday , prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office , government sources said . The resignations , which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota , will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down , a government statement said . \"  All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them , \"  the statement said . The finance minister 's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government , if needed . Three deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations , a government statement said . A spokesman for South Africa 's ruling party , the African National Congress , confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki . Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year , which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win . Earlier this month , the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption , fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki 's political arch rival . The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki 's government of political interference . Mbeki -- who has been South Africa 's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address . Watch the significance of Mbeki \"  falling on the sword \"  \u00c2 \"  \"  I depart this office knowing that many men and woman in South Africa have worked to achieve better lives for all , \"  Mbeki said . Under his leadership the country has had the longest period of sustained economic growth in the South Africa 's history and has reached out to indigent people in an unprecedented way , Mbeki said . Mbeki said the country still has economic , corruption and crime challenges to face in the future . And he gave his vote of confidence to the country 's next leader without naming who that leader would be . Gwede Mantashe , secretary-general of the African National Congress , announced Saturday that the party -- which Mbeki has been involved with since his teens -- had asked him to leave before his term was up . Mbeki agreed to do so , he said . Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"  for the citizens of South Africa , so there could be stability within the country \"  and so the ANC movement could remain \"  stable and unified . \"  The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006 , but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him . Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma 's guilt or innocence , and he could be recharged . Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma 's popularity , particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions . Zuma has denied the charges . He said the case was politically motivated , and harmed his chances to become the ANC 's presidential nominee . He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal . He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma 's political influence to benefit his businesses .

For us it was like going somewhere very special , far away , because under the Communist regime you did n't travel that much and Prague was \"  wow . \"  I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague , even now , I 'm still amazed . The lighting at night ; the incredible architecture ; the details ; the history ; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover . It was a very special experience . The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once , twice a week from my town to Prague . I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning , take the bus for one hour , then a tram to school . After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague . So it was quite intense at that time , but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent . CNN : How would you describe Prague , in five words ? Petra Nemcova : Prague is a city of romance , of incredible architecture and history . Some people call it the \"  golden city , \"  some people say it 's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French do n't like that very much ! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris . Prague has more of a calming vibe . It 's not rush-rush-rush . I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors . I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association . But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done . Before Prague was shades of grey and black , which was quite mysterious , but now it 's more happy and pretty . In five words it 's historical , inspirational , creative , romantic and beautiful . CNN : What was your childhood like ? Petra Nemcova : Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I did n't understand the whole concept of communism . I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened . I had a really beautiful childhood ... I did n't have the great luxury things , we had very little and we counted every penny . But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that 's priceless . We did n't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries . So we went around our country to see different castles , little towns and I loved it . So that made us richer . It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature . And the values you learn there are priceless too . You do n't step on flowers , kick on mushrooms , you really respect nature . And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit . Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine , it brings me back to my childhood . But it was harder for my parents . Because if you were n't part of the system then you did n't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you . My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you did n't get enough stamps throughout the year , you would get in trouble . CNN : What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami ? Petra Nemcova : I lost my partner and physically , my pelvis was broken four times , I was drowning many times throughout the experience . There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones . Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers , there was just a lot of love around in that moment . That 's what happens actually if you live through disasters , it brings people together , it shows that we are capable of that compassion , but unfortunately it just goes away after some time .

Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly , fathering seven children with her . Six of the children survived .

Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten , where staff grew suspicious and called police , who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse .

Schloss described Frank , whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world 's mostly widely-read books , as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble . \"  She got her diary in 1942 , so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories , \"  said Schloss . \"  She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack . Very often she used to write hundreds of lines -LSB- at school -RSB- of ` I 'm not going to talk so much , ' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell . \"  In some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes . Watch more about Schloss ' story \"  Schloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War . But while Schloss was more of an introvert , Frank loved the limelight . Schloss said : \"  I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention . We had steps where we sat , and she had a crowd of children around her . \"  She was a big flirt -- she loved boys . She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time . She was always interested in her clothes . Her style , she always changed it . Sometimes she had curls , then she had straight hair . \"  Schloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe , placing their lives in increasing jeopardy . \"  Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened . \"  You could n't go out anymore after 8 o'clock , but for a 11 to 12 year old it did n't matter so much . Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we could n't do , but we really did n't really take it seriously at that time . \"  Like Frank , Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland . Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank 's office . But Schloss and her family had to split up . Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere . She and her mother moved around , staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period . Eventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps , where Frank died at the age of 15 .

H.G. Ragavendhra , Jaipur 's superintendent of police , told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . Jaipur , known as the \"  pink city \"  for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population .

She also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . Furthermore , Raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years .

Claudio Lifschitz shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back . Claudio Lifschitz , 43 , said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on Friday night and put a plastic bag over his head . They then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association -LRB- AMIA -RRB- building in Buenos Aires on July 18 , 1994 , he said . Eighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II . \"  The police are investigating -LSB- the alleged kidnapping -RSB- as we speak , \"  said Miguel Ambrosio , legal secretary in the office of federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral . \"  Once the judge heard the details of the alleged incident , he ordered an investigation to the police via telephone . \"  Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation . \"  I heard the noise of a blowtorch , and that 's when the worst started , and I started to feel a burn on my left arm , and I could smell my hair on my arm burning , \"  Lifschitz told CNN . \"  Then I felt them slicing my back with a knife . \"  Images of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters ` AMIA ' had been scratched . The assailants also carved numbers into his arm ; the significance of the digits is unclear . Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted . He was treated for injuries in a hospital . \"  They told me that I would n't die unless they wanted me to , \"  he said Sunday . Lifschitz , who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police , is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano , who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case . Lifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation , including allegedly making a $ 400,000 bribe to a key witness . Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005 . The investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years , with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption . Argentina , Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack . In March 2007 , Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing . Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement . Former Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up . Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify . He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up . Lifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection . \"  They started to ask about information about the SIDE -LRB- State Intelligence Secretariat -RRB- related to the AMIA attack , \"  Lifschitz told CNN . \"  And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians . That shows that the SIDE does n't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges . \"  They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge , but I told them that I do n't have any copies of the tapes . \"  Lifschitz , who said he is a non-practicing Jew , also told CNN the men were interested in his religion . \"  I always wear a rosary around my neck , and they grabbed me by the neck and said , ` Why are you wearing this if you 're a Jew ?

Most vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer . \u2022 Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety , a consumer watchdog group , says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls . The center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who have n't complied fully with recalls . \"  Insurers have the VIN -LSB- vehicle identification numbers -RSB- , and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply , \"  Ditlow says . Because states are responsible for issuing a vehicle 's registration , Ditlow sees an opportunity for state governments to force compliance . He says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer 's fix has been made . However , he says , no states have taken this step so far . \u2022 According to Edmunds.com , some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car . \u2022 Jeanne Salvatore , with the Insurance Information Institute , says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects , then go after Toyota for reimbursements . \u2022 CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car . \u2022 If recall communications are deemed insufficient , the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer .

Claudio Lifschitz shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back . Claudio Lifschitz , 43 , said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on Friday night and put a plastic bag over his head . They then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association -LRB- AMIA -RRB- building in Buenos Aires on July 18 , 1994 , he said . Eighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II . \"  The police are investigating -LSB- the alleged kidnapping -RSB- as we speak , \"  said Miguel Ambrosio , legal secretary in the office of federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral . \"  Once the judge heard the details of the alleged incident , he ordered an investigation to the police via telephone . \"  Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation . \"  I heard the noise of a blowtorch , and that 's when the worst started , and I started to feel a burn on my left arm , and I could smell my hair on my arm burning , \"  Lifschitz told CNN . \"  Then I felt them slicing my back with a knife . \"  Images of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters ` AMIA ' had been scratched . The assailants also carved numbers into his arm ; the significance of the digits is unclear . Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted . He was treated for injuries in a hospital . \"  They told me that I would n't die unless they wanted me to , \"  he said Sunday . Lifschitz , who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police , is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano , who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case . Lifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation , including allegedly making a $ 400,000 bribe to a key witness . Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005 . The investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years , with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption . Argentina , Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack . In March 2007 , Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing . Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement . Former Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up . Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify . He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up . Lifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection . \"  They started to ask about information about the SIDE -LRB- State Intelligence Secretariat -RRB- related to the AMIA attack , \"  Lifschitz told CNN . \"  And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians . That shows that the SIDE does n't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges . \"  They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge , but I told them that I do n't have any copies of the tapes . \"  Lifschitz , who said he is a non-practicing Jew , also told CNN the men were interested in his religion . \"  I always wear a rosary around my neck , and they grabbed me by the neck and said , ` Why are you wearing this if you 're a Jew ? ' \"  In addition to the AMIA attack , a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17 , 1992 , when 29 people died and more than 250 were injured in a bombing at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires .

Lisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it is facing foreclosure After living in apartments , the spacious house got her attention immediately . \"  It was bigger than what I had lived in , \"  she says . Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district . \"  I wanted to come here , and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district . \"  But they hardly had a chance . Instead , fighting back tears , she says , \"  I have to get out . \"  Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did , but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure . The house was recently sold at auction . The bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in . A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice , telling her she had 30 days to vacate . \"  I was hysterical , I was like , what do you mean ? \"  Watch Lisa Brown 's talk about why she has to move \"  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid . Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure . As a tenant , she always paid her rent on time , and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage . \"  I did n't see there was a problem , \"  she said . \"  You know , I 'm paying rent , and she 's putting it toward her mortgage , I did n't see the problem . \"  Unfortunately , Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard . According to the Center for Housing Policy , nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties , and tenants ' rights in such situations are minimal . In most states , when a bank forecloses on a landlord , the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property , and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure . So while the owners know what 's going on , renters are usually kept in the dark . New York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems . \"  In many instances , they 're actually paying their rent on time , and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money , \"  he says . Klein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York , and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go . Similar laws are already in place in Ohio , Illinois , Minnesota , Maryland , Rhode Island , Michigan and California . \"  What we 're facing here \"  , Klein says , \"  is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it . \"  Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it . \"  She knew that this house was foreclosing on her . She did nothing about it . Nothing , except take my money . \"  Brown was paying $ 1,900 a month in rent . She had also paid $ 5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house .

NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians . U.S. forces in Afghanistan are doing everything possible to free Bergdahl , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday . Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a news conference they were disgusted at the video that Bergdahl 's captors released . \"  My personal reaction was one of disgust at the exploitation of this young soldier , \"  Gates said . In the 28-minute video , Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents , siblings , nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry . \"  I have a very , very good family that I love back home in America , and I miss them every day that I 'm gone , \"  he says . \"  I miss them , and I 'm afraid I might never see them again and that I 'll never be able to tell them I love them again .

The Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl 's kidnapping , the military said . Last week , the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him . \"  As you can see , the American soldier is in good shape and good health , and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners , \"  said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video . \"  Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , may God protect him . \"  The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations . In the video , Bergdahl 's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar , saying the move was accomplished \"  very easily . \"  The claim could not be independently verified . Asked the date by his captor , Bergdahl says it is July 14 . Two versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan , written in the Pashto language . They were made available to CNN by U.S. forces in Afghanistan . One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands with a group of kids with the message , \"  One of our American guests is missing . Return the guest to his home . Call us at \"  -- and lists a phone number . The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door , and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier , his head and arms drooping , and the words , \"  If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted . \"  The goal of the pamphlets was to balance the effort to get Bergdahl back with how U.S. forces interact with the local population , Gates and Mullen said Monday . Mullen said the message of the second pamphlet was \"  not threatening , but to express that we will do what we have to do to find this individual . \"  Days after Bergdahl went missing , a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl was captured by low-level militants and then quickly \"  sold \"  to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani , who is believed to be deeply involved in the action . The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military . Bergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself , the official said . Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province , got drunk and was ambushed while returning to his car . Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place . CNN could not independently verify Sangeen 's claims . A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk . \"  The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming -LSB- is -RSB- not true , \"  the source said . In the video , Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol .

Assistant lab supervisor Trevor Valle discusses the teeth and lower jaw of Columbian mammoth fossil \"  Zed . \"  Now , at least 10,000 years later , visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of \"  Zed , \"  a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles ' George C. Page Museum . Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles . An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth 's skull , according to project director Christopher Shaw . \"  The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper , \"  Shaw told CNN Thursday . \"  We do n't know just how smashed up it is , but it 's fairly intact because it 's a huge jacket we put it around . \"  The mammoth 's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"  tree-boxed \"  along with the surrounding dirt , creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact . Zed 's remains were encased in a plaster jacket . The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones . Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum , who began analyzing the various fossils in June , Shaw said . \"  It 's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years , \"  Shaw said . John Harris , the head curator of the Page Museum , publicly announced the finding of \"  a whole new treasure trove of fossils \"  on Wednesday . He described it as \"  the most important discovery \"  for the museum \"  of the last 90 years . \"  Shaw said the announcement was made to \"  create interest \"  in the museum 's discovery . Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed , who is believed to have died in his late 40s . Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years . Not all of Zed 's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed . \"  Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated , including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis , one tusk and the lower jaw , \"  Shaw said . \"  It will take another six to 12 months to open everything . \"  Shaw said both of Zed 's tusks were found intact , which is very rare . \"  Previously , we 've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved , \"  Shaw said . \"  It 's very exciting to us to have these two complete , beautifully preserved tusks . \"  The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum 's attendance and funding , which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession . \"  The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the ` fishbowl ' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned , \"  Shaw said . \"  So people come to see us and we 've constructed small exhibits . It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation . \"  Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year .

Last month , the FDA warned nine companies to stop selling unapproved pain-relief drugs . After talking with hospital and hospice organizations , which expressed concern that taking the product off the market would result in hardship for terminally ill patients and their caregivers , the agency decided to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml . The agency wants to ensure there is no shortage of the drug while patients wait for an approved product to take its place . \"  While the FDA remains committed to ultimately ensuring that all prescription drugs on the market are FDA approved , we have to balance that goal with flexibility and compassion for patients who have a few alternatives for the alleviation of their pain , \"  Dr. Douglas Throckmorton , deputy director of the FDA 's Center for drug Evaluation and Research , said Thursday . \"  In light of the concerns raised by these patients and their health-care providers , we have adjusted our actions with regard to these particular products . \"  Last month , the FDA sent warning letters to nine companies telling them to stop manufacturing 14 unapproved narcotics that are widely used to treat pain .

Other companies did not immediately return calls from CNN . The FDA estimates there are several thousand drugs , mostly older products , marketed illegally without FDA approval in this country . Once an illegally marketed drug is identified , enforcement action begins because the agency does not have information on the quality of these drugs and has not had an opportunity to approve their labeling . In 1976 the agency began a program to bring companies manufacturing these drugs into compliance . Thursday 's announcement applies only to the morphine sulfate elixir 20mg/ml , and the warning letters sent to the other product manufacturers are still in effect .

The insurgents captured five members of parliament and paraded them through the city streets , with hundreds of residents looking on , the reporter said . The five were released after publicly surrendering . The situation left Somali lawmakers stranded in the neighboring country of Djibouti , where they often convene and where talks on forming a new government are under way . \"  We have nowhere to return to , \"  Parliament Speaker Aden Mohamed Nur told fellow lawmakers there . Somalia 's U.N.-backed transitional government took office after Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006 . The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union , an Islamist movement that had claimed control of the capital Mogadishu earlier that year . Ethiopia 's invasion had the blessing of the United States , which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda . But various Islamist groups -- including the hard-line Al-Shabab , which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government . Ethiopia announced on Sunday that all its forces have left Somalia . Last week , as Ethiopian troops began pulling out of the Somali capital , forces from different Islamist groups -- including Al-Shabab -- took control of bases the Ethiopians abandoned around Mogadishu . The transitional government maintained very little control outside of Baidoa , even with the support of the Ethiopian forces . It has also been wracked by an internal power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed , who resigned in December . In Washington , the State Department said U.S. officials are working to independently confirm the reports from Baidoa . But State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said members of one of the major Islamic factions , which signed a peace agreement in October in Djibouti , are already joining the transitional government . Duguid said the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia , another offshoot of the ICU , will choose up to 200 new members of the transitional parliament . Another 75 members will be drawn from other opposition groups , and the expanded parliament is expected to elect a new president soon . \"  We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in southern Somalia , which continues to claim innocent lives , \"  Duguid said . \"  Lasting peace and stability in Somalia can only be established through the reconciliation process underway through the Djibouti Agreement and rejection of extremism . \"  With Monday 's takeover of", "99eb66b72cc434f8beafda5cd6dfd3e91938de495": "The U.S. Coast Guard said it has witnessed only normal maritime traffic around", "6a043cd8aff9a54ebfa907fb7a98c288c72347eb7": "Consumer Electronics", "551839469c1133ef4697ed435c5de192e607685812": "John would be very happy with this , \"  she", "8ca27bfab0c31ac19c73c03a76a7918afb4c04ea2": "Watch museum officials pay tribute \"  James von Brunn , an outspoken Holocaust denier who had served six years in prison for a 1981 kidnapping attempt , was shot and wounded by Johns ' fellow officers .", "c7c83a9ee902e568a55898c616f20181952ce05710": "$ 12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns .", "0f937bcc8cd07bab2d5aa9a4492d3c2430063b671": "influences in next month 's run-off election , likening one American diplomat to a \"  prostitute \"  and threatening to oust another from his country .

Five masked men dressed in black appear on the video , sitting behind a long table . The spokesman explains that they are a group called the \"  Mata Zetas , \"  or Zeta Killers . They describe themselves as an \"  extermination \"  force that works as the armed front \"  of the people and for the people . \"  The speaker says that the group 's only goal is to kill members of the Zetas , a ruthless cartel whose area of influence includes the eastern state of Veracruz . Members of the Mata Zetas are prohibited from committing crimes such as extortion or kidnappings , according to the video . The video was released via YouTube days after 35 bodies were found in two trucks during rush hour in the city of Boca del Rio . But is the video really evidence of the birth of a vigilante group in Veracruz ? In the video , the speaker does not claim responsibility for the 35 deaths . It is also not the first time that a seemingly grassroots group emerged in Veracruz as a counterbalance to the cartels . In 2007 , a group named the \"  Gente Nueva , \"  or New People , made itself known through menacing notes , web-posted videos , torture and executions and quasi-patriotic rhetoric . The group left notes next to bodies , claiming that the victims were Zetas or supporters of the Zetas . But U.S. officials with knowledge of the group said Gente Nueva was not a vigilante group but a facade for the Sinaloa cartel , which at the time was battling the Zetas and Gulf Cartel in Veracruz . The Zetas and Gulf cartel have since split into warring factions . Mexico 's attorney general 's office responded with a statement saying that it would investigate the video and any group that tries to take justice into its own hands . \"  The only path to reach long-lasting security and peace is through the rule of law and strengthening of our institutions , \"  the statement said .", "93a2c00e0bff456b48e713244da3ea98dd8c6a3f2": "Barack Obama", "90ba568443486427c40cb12268d3e14629ded9f49": "There 's no doubt \"  that the deadly attack on India 's financial capital last month was planned inside Pakistan , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Sunday . People in New Delhi , India , take part in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Mumbai attacks on Sunday . Her comments to CNN 's \"  Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer \"  were the most definitive made by a top-ranking U.S. official regarding Pakistan 's connection to the November 26-29 attack on Mumbai , in which more than 170 were killed and hundreds of others were wounded . \"  Well , I think there 's no doubt that Pakistani territory was used by probably non-state actors , \"  Rice said . \"  I do n't think that there is compelling evidence of involvement of Pakistani officials . But I do think that Pakistan has a responsibility to act , and it does n't matter that they 're non-state actors . \"  Last week , Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan , both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States . While in New Delhi , India , she called on Pakistan to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders . Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said \"  stateless actors \"  carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis , specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- , an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan . U.S. counterterrorism officials say signs point to LeT , and they have n't seen anything to rule it out . However , they have not definitively said the group is responsible . U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said during an appearance Tuesday at Harvard University that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in Mumbai in 2006 -- though he did n't specifically name LeT . LeT has denied any responsibility for the attacks , but a suspect in custody -- whom India has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by LeT , Indian authorities said . India said its forces killed nine gunmen . On Sunday , Rice said LeT and al Qaeda \"  tend to travel in the same circles , \"  though she declined to directly link either group to the Mumbai attack .

While vegetarians stay away from meat but may consume dairy and eggs , vegans give up all animal products . Some people become vegan for animal welfare reasons . Others view it as a way to reduce their carbon footprint . Still others choose the plant-based diet as part of a healthier lifestyle .

Not long afterward , the U.S. Air Force , operating an unmanned aerial vehicle , fired a Hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs , killing all three . Maj.

Al-Nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes , fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among Shiites . The assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the Shiite holy city of Najaf , anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood . Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation . Al-Sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a Web site . Spokesman Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers \"  are the ones who are following the occupiers ' steps and do n't want stability for the country . \"  But al-Obeidi called the killing an \"  act of provocation \"  after the \"  siege of Sadr City . \"  He was referring to the battles since Sunday involving members of al-Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia and Iraqi security forces dominated by a rival Shiite political movement , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq .

The al-Nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in Hilla .

At least three national police officers were killed and five wounded , the official said . The second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- north of Baiji , according to police , who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded . The casualties were members of a local Awakening Council who were manning the checkpoint , police said . The suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep . Awakening Councils , or Sons of Iraq , are made up of Sunnis who have turned on al Qaeda in Iraq . Also , at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on Baghdad 's Palestine Hotel , an Interior Ministry official said .

Internationally , several European countries , including Denmark , Belgium , the United Kingdom and France , are pioneering the new field , said Fanny Douvere , a co-principal investigator at UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission . Ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming . One reason it 's taken so long is that people ca n't see that the oceans are filling up , said Sandra Whitehouse , a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy , an environmental group . \"  The majority of the ecosystem is under the water , \"  Whitehouse said . \"  So it 's out of sight , out of mind . We 're only looking at the surface . \"  Beneath the water , though , overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse . By one report , wild fish could disappear by mid-century . The energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water . Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales . Fish farms are growing in some countries . Climate change is altering ocean chemistry . And power lines , reefs , lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space . In Europe 's North Sea , expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available , said Douvere , of UNESCO . What happens on land also affects the oceans . A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year , coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat . Furthermore , pavement on land creates \"  expressways \"  for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean . \"  Every eight months , nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill , \"  the report says . When the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea , the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan , said Whitehouse , of the Ocean Conservancy . \"  There 's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy , \"  she said , \"  but it 's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way , because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans .", "82a8267332419fa254632187286d12be4f544aa11": "manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup .

He whisked Morgan into the operating room , pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson : an epidural hematoma . McCracken remembers standing in the emergency room , feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him . \"  My heart sank , \"  he says . \"  It just sank . \"  Unlike Richardson 's , Morgan 's story has a happy ending . After surgery and five days in the hospital , she 's at home and doing fine . \"  Dr. Cohen told us that if we had n't brought her in Thursday night , she never would have woken up , \"  McCracken says . Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor . After hearing about Richardson 's death , many people are asking themselves the same question : Do all head injuries need attention , even ones that seem minor ? \"  Sometimes there 's a gray zone , and there 's no right answer , \"  Cohen says . Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \"  In most cases , it 's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury , says Greg Ayotte , a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist . \"  They 're confused , they 're agitated , or they might be dizzy or unresponsive , \"  he says . But then there 's what doctors call the \"  talk and die \"  scenario , where someone seems fine , only to die hours , or sometimes even days later . \"  Talk and die \"  can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries . In the case of epidural hematomas , the injury Richardson and Morgan had , blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull . \"  Fluid is building up in a contained space , creating pressure . Something 's got to give , and that something is the brain , \"  Ayotte says . If you do n't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid , \"  the deterioration can happen very quickly . \"  Here , from Ayotte and other experts , is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury . 1 . Be vigilant Keep an eye on someone who has hit his head , even if the person never lost consciousness . \"  A lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you 're not knocked out , you 're OK , and that 's not true , \"  Ayotte says . 2 . Look for dizziness , vomiting , headache and confusion If the injured person has these signs , take him or her to an emergency room , says Dr. Jam Ghajar , clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York , and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation . 3 . Look for changes in symptoms and behavior Any sudden change , such as Morgan 's headache going from mild to severe in minutes , means the person needs medical attention . For example , Ghajar says , if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit , it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed . 4 . Be especially wary if someone a -RRB- has been drinking alcohol , b -RRB- is on blood thinners , c -RRB- is elderly or d -RRB- is a young athlete It 's tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior , so when in doubt , take the person to the hospital , Ghajar says . Also , blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed , so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin . He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens . The CDC also has information on concussions in young athletes . 5 . Go to a certified trauma center if you can The American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities ; a hospital that 's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call .", "3bb0115e2c06dd6f6480bfef18b74654ea93baae1": "Malmo is a shopper 's heaven .", "2f482e021caf07e2f07baf111c36d1587758f1888": "CNN", "733e66bb63927f78091b5877fc6a9c589d45268c3": "South Korea echoed Clinton 's statements . \"  The South Korean government believes that if the North conducts its launch despite continuous warnings of the South Korean government and the international community , it is a provocative action that constitutes a serious threat to the security of northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula , \"  said Foreign Ministry spokesman Moon Tae-Young .", "bb21e41a081075fe19b3edf0a4f8c0c30d1c5fa92": "In the absence of basic medical", "9c31b082f00d80d335350dcff3d91b6a170d8fe13": "Police first found the mother-in-law shot in her bed in a downstairs bedroom , Moore said .", "fdb54e157f8f4e5a479dbc6288587e52fffde33f7": "Osama : \"  Find another way . \"  Omar bin Laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al Qaeda .

So far , pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia 's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40 , according to the International Maritime Bureau . Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker , a chemical tanker , and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms , including tanks . The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom .

In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach . He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach , is shot , falls , and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach . 3 . \"  Ben Hur \"  -LRB- William Wyler , 1959 -RRB- Stunt : Chariot race Stuntman : Joe Canutt Canutt -LRB- son of Yakima -RRB- doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race . Half way through , things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot . When his charito hits , Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot , where he clings before clambering back on . The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured . 4 . \"  Raiders of the Lost Ark \"  -LRB- Stephen Spielberg , 1981 -RRB- Stunt : Truck drag Stuntman : Terry Leonard This intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck . A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver . Harrison Ford , an accomplished stuntman in his own right , performed an earlier portion of the sequence , where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament . 5 . \"  GoldenEye \"  -LRB- Martin Campbell , 1995 -RRB- Stunt : 750 foot bungee jump Stuntman : Wayne Michaels This breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take .

As Schwarzenegger 's stunt double he performed the T-101 's famous motorbike jump into a massive storm drain .

She clings precariously to the bonnet of a car going at 85 miles per hour while receiving hits from a second car in a long , climactic chase scene . Bell is a stuntwoman by trade but it 's easy to see why Tarantino flouted the unspoken Hollywood convention that stuntmen stay out of the limelight and cast her as the film 's lead .

A spokesman for South Africa 's ruling party , the African National Congress , confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki . Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year , which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win . Earlier this month , the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption , fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki 's political arch rival . The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki 's government of political interference . Mbeki -- who has been South Africa 's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address .

Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma 's popularity , particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions . Zuma has denied the charges . He said the case was politically motivated , and harmed his chances to become the ANC 's presidential nominee . He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal .

This week , the first of 1,500 Marines will be part of the initial wave of President Obama 's surge plan to head to Afghanistan 's restive provinces to support Marines and soldiers fighting a dug-in Taliban force . However , many Marines we talked to in this coastal , scrub pine-covered North Carolina base are more than excited to go , despite the dangers that await them . \"  I 'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation . I 've got a good group of Marines that are behind me , so I 'm real excited about the deployment , \"  said Sgt. Jason Bendett of the 3rd Platoon , A Company , 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion , based at Lejeune . But combat deaths in Afghanistan are up -- 305 this year , from 155 during 2008 -- giving pause to even the most motivated Marines . \"  I think I would n't be human if I was n't worried , obviously this being my first combat deployment , but the Taliban are an experienced group of fighters , and I 'm not taking that for granted , \"  2nd Lt. John Auer , also of the 3rd Platoon , said during some of his final rifle range training before he deploys . Members of this unit say they have been waiting and waiting as they watched fellow Marines deploy ahead of them this year , and they say they are more than ready to go . They were supposed to go to Iraq in June , but as priorities shifted , they were reassigned to Afghanistan 's Helmand province , where Marines are in daily battles with the Taliban . \"  Having months to train and putting Marines out in the elements in Southern California , where we train , gives them a chance to see what the atmospherics are going to be like and to work as a team , so this is perfect , and we are really looking forward to this , \"  Auer said . \"  These guys have a lot of training under their belts , more than Marine units typically get in this situation . Senior military leaders have a lot of big expectations for this team , \"  said the unit 's first sergeant , Ronald Neff . Last week , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. Mike Mullen , gave some of the deploying Marines an impassioned speech about what they will face . \"  We do n't have a lot of time . The slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction , and it has picked up , three years , each year to a significant degree , \"  Mullen said , describing the deteriorating security situation . \"  I believe the strategy that the president laid out , the decision that he 's made , is the right decision . Both those are right , and we will now move out , given our orders , and we 'll carry them out . And again , I could n't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that , \"  he told the hundreds of Marines in attendance . Many of the Marines there are young and are facing their first combat deployment . Although all the bravado of a newly minted Marine ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight , their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to Mullen . \"  Best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself , that you 're not going to freeze up , \"  Lance Cpl. Matthew Jenkins said after Mullen 's speech . \"  We 'll see how I react when it goes down in a couple weeks , \"  said Lance Cpl. Joshua Williamson . Questions remain , however , about how so many Marines without combat experience in Afghanistan can jump into a heated combat zone . Mullen admitted some concerns . \"  We 're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that . I understand that , but I have a huge amount of confidence in our Marine Corps based on their ability to adapt , what they did in Iraq , \"  he said . There seems to be little worry among unit leaders in the 3/2nd LAR , who have been training and watching their troops grow in skills and confidence in recent months . \"  One thing about the Marine Corps is that you always have experience wherever you go , \"  Auer said . \"  So we 've got Marines that have done deployments before and the training they have given me , I 'm confident to where I can lead my platoon , but I 'm also relying on staff NCOs -LRB- non-commissioned officers -RRB- that have years of experience . \"  That experience we have from the different deployments in Iraq , I 'm relying on all the NCOs to carry their weight , and with that I do n't think there is anything that can get in our way , \"  Auer continued . For the families of these Marines , deployments are never easy , especially when they know that their husbands and wives are moving to a region known for its hostility . \"  I 'm glad he 's going where he 's needed . It would be a waste for him to go where he 's not needed and not be able to do his job , \"  said Kim Durbin , wife of deploying Marine Lt. Dan Durbin . \"  It 's just not him in the Marine Corps , it 's our family , and we are proud to be a part of it , \"  she said .

In the wake of the government collapse , the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing . This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia . According to one report , some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion . As recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse . To add to the burden , the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping . In 2005 , U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore . The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences . No matter what we think of their current methods , it 's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue . Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government . Similarly , we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind . These environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas . Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles . Faced with this response it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products , carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives . Given the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq , piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region . In a worst-case scenario , the region could become an incubator for terrorist cells or a depot for training international jihadists -- if it has n't already . Resolving this problem will likely involve precisely the kind of nation-building the United States once disdained and are now engaged in with Afghanistan . They amount to the back-end costs of the Cold War . These pirates are not romantic heroes and their actions have generated an entirely different set of problems in Somalia , but they have our attention . In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here : innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes .

Most of the state , which endured a particularly harsh winter , remained under a flood warning Wednesday , with forecasters predicting possibly record flood levels on several rivers . Snow , which continued to fall Wednesday , complicated preparations , city officials said . \"  I woke up this morning and looked outside , I guess I thought of the same thing everybody else did . ... -LSB- What -RSB- came to mind is what a revolting development this is , \"  said Mark Voxland , the mayor of Moorhead , Minnesota , a city just outside of Fargo .

The river is expected to crest between 39 and 41 feet in Fargo on Friday , according to Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services . The record for the Red River at Fargo was set in 1897 at 40.1 feet , according to Pat Slattery of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

U.S. Marines fire 120mm mortars on Taliban positions on April 3 in Now Zad in Helmand province , Afghanistan . The incident occurred south of Kabul in the eastern Afghan province of Logar , when Afghan security forces and ISAF troops were conducting an operation . It comes as NATO members meet in Europe to discuss the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and as human rights groups this week urged NATO and the U.S. military to avoid civilian casualties and develop a well-coordinated condolence payment system for civilians victimized in the war . Troops saw a large group of insurgents placing a roadside bomb . The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms . Troops surrounded the compound and urged them to surrender peacefully after it was cordoned off . It also asked the people in the compound to release women and children but no civilians left . Troops assaulted the compound and 12 male insurgents were killed in gunfire . Troops found one woman who was killed in the crossfire by insurgent small arms fire , ISAF said . An investigation is being conducted by Afghan National Security Forces at the site . Initial indications show that the woman was killed by insurgent small arms fire . Eight AK47 rifles , two rocket propelled grenade launchers , several rocket canisters , 82mm mortars , and two heavy machine guns were found in the compound . \"  ANSF and ISAF are making significant progress against insurgent groups in Logar province who are involved in murdering civilians with IEDs , \"  said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette , ISAF spokesman . \"  Today 's firefight illustrates the difference between ISAF troops who risk their lives to protect civilians , and insurgents who deliberately and tragically place civilians at risk . \"  Also , ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan . The soldier died of wounds and another was injured after what was described as a \"  hostile incident . \"  \"  On behalf of the men and women of the International Security Assistance Force , I offer our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the brave soldier killed , and our support to the soldier wounded in this incident , \"  Blanchette said . \"  As we recognize their sacrifice in our battle against a vicious insurgency , we will continue supporting the Afghan National Security Forces so that the Afghan people reap the tangible benefits of peace in their day-to-day lives . \"  Overnight in the southern Afghan", "3fca9a7334698cf129de02e53c3c68de3e06ce6a4": "midday Sunday in an area of Texas from Dallas south to Austin .", "ac6b4711b2131b9c11bf7d630411b3a223ab07431": "Israel is in the 12th day of a military operation against Hamas militants , who have been firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel .

A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it 's vital for Obama to appeal to them .

The uneasiness with Kagan 's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School , which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions . They were quick to blast out blogs , columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity . When a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett , I was told \"  more listening than talking \"  was done by the administration . Civil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process , and were expected to rubber stamp the choice . When Kagan 's nomination was unveiled Monday , the only prominent African-Americans in attendance were Charles Ogletree , a Harvard professor who taught both Obamas , and Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights . That 's a stark contrast to Sotomayor 's unveiling , when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid . That 's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , the National Urban League and others , they are more neutral on Kagan 's appointment , saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out .

It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver 's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later . The 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way , and many riders say it 's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70 . A roundtrip ticket costs between $ 49 and $ 85 .

As a result , black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues , unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions . Instead , they quietly fume , mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones . Yet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for . I 've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate . The nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship , because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration did n't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job . The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court , and it was embraced by civil rights groups . Yet this time , for highly qualified African-American female judges , such as Leah Ward Sears , the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court , to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I 've talked with over the last several days . What 's the big deal about including a black woman ? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it 's vital for Obama to appeal to them . When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls , it was because black women had n't embraced him yet . When they did , the race changed . The uneasiness with Kagan 's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School , which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions . They were quick to blast out blogs , columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity . When a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett , I was told \"  more listening than talking \"  was done by the administration . Civil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process , and were expected to rubber stamp the choice . When Kagan 's nomination was unveiled Monday , the only prominent African-Americans in attendance were Charles Ogletree , a Harvard professor who taught both Obamas , and Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights . That 's a stark contrast to Sotomayor 's unveiling , when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid . That 's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , the National Urban League and others , they are more neutral on Kagan 's appointment , saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out . Folks , that 's lukewarm at best . I 've heard the previous complaints that congressional and civil rights leaders have been ignored by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , with one saying he has never attended a meeting with them -LRB- \"  Even Bush sent Andy Card to meet with us , \"  one leader told me -RRB- . And that extends to others surrounding the president in various parts of the White House . \"  These problems are valid and BIG , and we can not let them off the hook , \"  I was told by one frustrated organizational head . Yet this time is different . White House officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the Rev. Al Sharpton , but this goes beyond him . The Rev. Jesse Jackson is clearly on the outs with this administration , as seen in his banishment from the West Wing . But this contentious relationship is with civil rights , religious , economic and social justice officials . And it 's getting worse .

But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors , observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother , if still an effort in patience . As of 7 p.m. Tuesday , the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips , setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go . \"  Throughout the weekend , we 've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds , \"  said Metro General Manager John Catoe . \"  By 5 p.m. , people had taken nearly 874,000 trips , breaking yesterday 's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go . \"  Monday 's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record . The Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone . Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m. , three hours before Obama took his oath of office . A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration , according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane 's , a leading information provider on defense , international risk and national security . Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly , although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications , such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be . The crowd was orderly , and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns . FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far . FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people , but none was anything serious . About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first-aid needs . Some security screening lines ran slowly , officials said , but there had not been any major systemic problems . Earlier in the day , federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration , according to the Department of Homeland Security . The FBI was investigating two \"  streams of intelligence \"  suggesting that Somalia-based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event , the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN . Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level , an administration official said . The ceremony went off without incident . Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab , also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement , a \"  Foreign Terrorist Organization \"  in February . The State Department calls it \"  a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda . Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan . \"  Also Tuesday , a false alarm prompted police to temporarily close a 25-mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike , authorities said . Investigators had received a tip that a man headed to Washington was threatening the inaugural , but they eventually determined \"  there is no danger to the public , \"  FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said . Two law enforcement sources said the man 's mother phoned in a tip to authorities saying her son was traveling in a vehicle containing a bomb . New Jersey State Police stopped a man in a vehicle on the highway Tuesday afternoon , questioned him and searched his vehicle , several law enforcement sources said .

Tetris , the simple puzzle video game , has been addicting players for 25 years . In 1984 , Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration : How about creating a computer version ? Pajitnov wrote the program in his spare time , simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who are n't math geniuses . He used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"  Tetris , \"  which comes from the Greek word for four , \"  Tetra . \"  In the game , players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between . Successfully completed sections disappear . The more sections the player completes without reaching the top , the higher the score . iReport : 25 years of Tetris Steadily , the game worked its way around the world . Millions of people found themselves glued to their computers and game players -- hearts racing and screaming in frustration -- all over getting a simple horizontal line of digital squares to disappear . \"  I would just play it for hours and hours , \"  said iReporter Joel Vetsch of New Haven , Connecticut , who got addicted to Tetris on a Game Boy when he was 10 . \"  I 'm 29 now , and I still love it . \"  See Vetsch 's iReport here Vetsch became so obsessed with Tetris that the game even showed up in his dreams . \"  I 'd go to sleep and in my head I 'd see blocks ... going into each other , \"  he told CNN . \"  It was weird . \"  More than 125 million Tetris products have been sold , and Guinness World Records ' 2009 Gamers ' Edition book ranked Tetris No. 2 on its list of the top 50 console games of all time , behind Super Mario Kart . Twenty-five years to the month after Tetris was born , CNN spoke with Pajitnov and Henk Rogers , CEO of Blue Planet Software , the company that manages the exclusive licensing rights to the game . The two men talked about what makes Tetris so addictive , how they believe the game can help unite the world , and -- no joke -- why they want a Tetris competition in the Olympics .

Henk Rogers , CEO of Blue Planet Software : When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988 , I kept on coming back and playing more .

Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007 . The report from the U.N. 's Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006 . Despite Afghan security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said . Opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground . The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan 's gross domestic product in 2007 . InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year . According to the U.N. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers . The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade . Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001 . \"  Since drugs are funding the insurgency , NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys , \"  Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey . \"  Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban 's main funding source . \"  James Appathurai , a NATO spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade . \"  We share the U.N. 's concerns , \"  Appathurai told CNN . \"  Drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation . \"  He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly . \"  The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO , but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government , \"  Appathurai said . Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , Appathurai said . However , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand , poppy production was going on largely unchecked . According to the report , U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes . Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region . He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors . \"  Drug trafficking is a transnational threat , and therefore national initiatives have their limitations , \"  the U.N. drug chief said . Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on .

Last week , on the third anniversary of Kesse 's disappearance , an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer . David Russ , a convicted killer being held at the Seminole County Jail , spoke last week with the missing woman 's father , Drew Kesse , claiming he had information that could lead to a break in the case . Details are being withheld from the public . In a jailhouse phone call with CNN , Russ hinted he 'd eavesdropped on other inmates . He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators . \"  The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and can not be trusted , \"  he said . That 's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman 's father , he said . Orlando police are just as skeptical of Russ . They said he provided information they already had . \"  His information is not some big break in the case , \"  said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department . \"  We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse . \"  The 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine . She went to work at her new job , came home to her new condominium and called her parents .

The next morning , she got up and showered for work . Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed , her family says , suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office . Then , she disappeared , her family said . She did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing . Police found Kesse 's Chevy Malibu two days later . It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived . Inside the vehicle , police found some of Kesse 's personal items , but her purse , wallet , two cell phones and briefcase were missing . The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found . Police later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse . The grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car , past a parking lot gate . Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman , because the image is partially obscured by the gate . The person is described as 5 feet 4 inches , with a short haircut , wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes . The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared . Forensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive , Sgt. Jones said . No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle . Drew Kesse said that every Tuesday , landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter 's parking space . The landscapers said they did n't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car , which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m.", "ec85ff070156e76ef37172ef705391d7fc3185506": "You have your mammogram , your radiologist , your oncologist .

The draft report , obtained by CNN and not yet approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency 's board of governors , is the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency 's strongest warning yet that Iran could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb . Zakaria told CNN the report should spur U.S. diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the U.S. government of a potential military strike against Iran was wrongheaded . \"  To be casually talking about military action because we 're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous , \"  he said . Iran 's Green Movement of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits , Zakaria said . \"  At the end of the day , time is not on the side of this regime . It 's a dysfunctional regime that has run the economy into the ground , taken a great and open and proud nation and turned it into a kind of paranoid and closed one and which is clearly losing the support of young Iranians by the day . \"  Zakaria , author and host of CNN 's \"  Fareed Zakaria GPS , \"  spoke to CNN on Thursday . CNN : The International Atomic Energy Agency has done a report saying that Iran could be at work on building a nuclear weapon . What do you think that means ? Fareed Zakaria : That 's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons . We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites . But it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership . One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons . ... This would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out . We do n't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly . ... CNN : What 's happening with the negotiations ? Zakaria : The Iranians have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith . ... They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they 're playing games . CNN : What 's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions ? Zakaria : It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere . I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime , which seems to be most powerful faction . And that 's the right approach to take . We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian , and that is entirely counterproductive . CNN : What 's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran , including the protest movement ? Zakaria : Nobody knows for sure , but it does seem to have confused the situation internally . -LSB- Iranian President Mahmoud -RSB- Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue , which were then attacked by the opposition , and he retracted it , which suggests that he 's feeling the pressure . It suggests that there are divisions within the regime , there 's some sense of vulnerability . ... It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them , but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran .", "42c027e4ff9730fbb3de84c1af0d2c506e41c3e410": "has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars , drink and celebrity parties .", "677375a4c69e81ab623af7c06a6b0a8d03d6350e0": "The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France 's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan .", "aa35fa6f613b29bf80806552b1bf260f04bbedc22": "Chinese is the second most common language on the Internet , according to The Economist , and quickly gaining ground on English .

General Assembly is in session , and so is this edition of CNN Student News . Bringing you today 's commercial-free headlines , I 'm Carl Azuz . First Up : Leaders Talk Climate Change AZUZ : First up , representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in New York to talk about global issues . This is called the United Nations General Assembly , and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year . One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change . Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century . He 's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , which many scientists believe contribute to climate change . During speeches yesterday , President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao , who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases , pledged to try to reduce them . Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this , but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources . President Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday : the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently , but Obama is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution . He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Despite all the mistrust , we have to find a way forward . We have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of Israelis and Palestinians in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering . Spoken Word SONNY PERDUE , GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA : This has been a 48-hour ordeal that people had been , stayed here and to care for the safety of people . I just want to thank them .

Eight years ago there were no golf courses but -- to fulfil the increasing domestic demand and as a means to attract tourists to the region -- the country could be set for a boom in golf development .

Jindal received negative reviews after the speech , and Larry asked him how he felt about that . They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh . The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity : Larry King : Governor , you took a lot of flak for that speech . Were you surprised that you did ? Gov. Bobby Jindal : Let 's be clear , the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we 've seen in a generation . I 'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is . And I 'm not the only one that 's got that opinion . I hope people look at the content of the speech , not just the delivery . You know , for years , I 've been told I speak too quickly . Now I 'm told I speak too slowly . What 's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package , with the leadership in Congress , with the administration . I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again . We need to put more money in the private sector . Watch Larry King 's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2 \"  Let 's cut taxes . Let 's get rid of the wasteful spending . That 's the debate . That 's the discussion we need to be having . King : But governor , to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis , when in some cases , they are the only answer , that pointed to a lot of the criticism , did n't it ? Jindal : If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described , I think you 'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support . We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway . Less than 5 percent of this bill was actually -LSB- for -RSB- the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described . ... Fundamentally , I do n't think $ 30 million for the federal government to buy new cars , $ 1 billion for the Census , $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs . King : There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry . No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit . Jindal : Well , Larry , I think that you 're absolutely right . One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party did n't match its actions with its rhetoric . ... I think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture . The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side . King : Governor , if perception is reality , do you think your speech hurt the party ? Jindal : I think that people are going to look at the content . I think people are going to be focused now that we 've -LSB- got -RSB- alternative views on how to move our country forward . Let me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get . Whenever we can find areas of agreement , we need to work across the aisle and put America first . But when we disagree , we need to offer principled alternative solutions . So for example , in health care , I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American . I just do n't think it should be a government-run program . King : All right , governor , here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend 's CPAC Conference . Watch . Rush Limbaugh : What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ? Why would I want that to succeed ? King : Governor , do you think people are thinking about capitalism now or are they thinking about problems ? Jindal : Look , clearly , the American people are worried about paying their mortgages , keeping their jobs and paying their health care bills . I think Rush is a great leader for conservatives . I think he articulates what a lot of people are concerned about . King : Do you want him -LSB- Obama -RSB- to fail ? Jindal : I do n't want those policies to be adopted . I want my country to succeed , but I do n't want policies to be adopted . King : What if the policies work ? Jindal : Well , again ... King : What if they work ? Jindal : This is where we have a fundamental disagreement . I do n't think it 's going work ... to spend in excess of our revenues . I want my country to succeed . But what I worry about is that simply spending money on new programs . Look at every new bailout . You talked about the auto bailouts . Then you had the fourth , I think it 's the fourth -- it 's hard to keep track -- AIG bailout today . It seems like every time you turn around , there 's another trillion dollar plan . King : One more thing . It may be moot now , but RNC Chairman Michael Steele took some shots at Limbaugh and then apologized . What do you make of all of that ? Jindal : Well , I did n't follow the day 's events . I 'm glad he apologized . I think the chairman is a breath of fresh air for the party . As I said before , I think Rush is a leader for many conservatives and says things that people are concerned about . -LSB- He -RSB- articulates very well the concern people have about growing government spending without an end in sight .", "cd69c6b1ae6ec892b25c041acf273df73a7cedd54": "is a former general secretary of the Communist", "cbc8d05b4292650eb86b27e336314ab5b28858a15": "The seven justices ruled unanimously that the local union had a right to display its 10-foot-tall , black , rat-shaped balloon at a rally held outside a fitness center .", "a16f1fcc107d3aee5ab49f45b2834658f96fb24b0": "She said they were told the vessel was American and the people aboard were unarmed .", "ab3c98cf7833b842898a568d872e45ceb2f7dda94": "Authorities in Fayetteville , North Carolina , are investigating the death of a pregnant soldier whose body was found Saturday morning in a motel , police said .", "04423c63496f8b4418efdf5dd97053ac2e78469b0": "Chertoff said 40,000", "3ad31f0dd26f2dce06da1c10ced8d601bd5594c55": "Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007 .

An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and , in severe cases , a shot of epinephrine .

For the Guardsmen , KBR 's \"  knowing acts and omissions \"  resulted in \"  months and months of unprotected , unknowing , direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man , \"  the lawsuit alleges . A spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit , but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant . \"  We are not providing comment on the suit at this time . The company does intend to vigorously defend itself , \"  KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said . The Guardsmen say the company knew about the dangers of exposure to the chemical as far back as 2003 , but did not act to protect the soldiers . \"  KBR managers knew full well long ago that this stuff was incredibly dangerous . But there was no information about it for years . And now these soldiers are facing some pretty serious health concerns . They 're going to be stuck with this the rest of their lives , \"  said Doyle . \"  The most frustrating thing is that these guys are finding out years later that they were exposed to something , \"  said Mike Doyle , one of the Houston attorneys representing the Guardsmen . KBR took issue with the allegation that the company knowingly exposed the soldiers or anyone else and did nothing to help . \"  KBR 's commitment to the safety and security of all employees , the troops and those we serve is the company 's top priority , \"  the statement read . \"  KBR appropriately notified the Army Corps of Engineers upon discovery of the existence of the substance on the site and the Corps of Engineers concluded that KBR 's efforts to remediate the situation were effective . Further , the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ .", "be69b853f62c35f58c9e77b6ddb888450d5b03fd4": "day before President Obama gives a prime-time address before a joint session of Congress .", "fc0e005b4a197dc1859240d9197a6fc54f8c01b13": "CNN -", "86eec1c30e12a822d2dfe88fe55e00c9a33977565": "Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves , they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure .", "82a94cf607660eb67aac057e3f5028c4cae75abf0": "The U.S. Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s , when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico .", "c52bcaad0217a941b9d504c84eb56f6fa86db66f5": "27", "b4cc1622ccf8a61c19c78c35adb10d92668fe3375": "Dlamini told CNN", "01a9836f1743877135e049fbe705f7618c3953b77": "$ 5,700", "87c41a0c17143a88ea8234f102c100868fe86e582": "Security expert Lou Palumbo told", "428edcd5c3380a5cc20b6a4fa0fba7c8dc88489d1": "have basic , durable , timeless , beautiful clothes , \"  said Stephan Bohle , one of the company founders .

The obscure state legislator with , as he put it , \"  a funny name \"  propelled himself onto the national stage at the Democratic National Convention four years ago with a speech so electrifying that commentators declared he would become America 's first black president . Election Day showed that , in this case at least , you can believe the hype . But Obama did not win the White House on hype , any more than he won it on hope . He won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant . He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama . He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game . And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage . Turning points Winning Iowa : Obama 's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest , and it pushed the \"  inevitable \"  Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton , back on her heels . He 'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate , harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him . Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan : Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers . Ted Kennedy : Within weeks of Iowa , all of Obama 's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton , who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday . It was then that Ted Kennedy , head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons , came out for Obama , comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother , President John F. Kennedy . The move was deeply symbolic , not just for the public but also the party . The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy . Addressing race : Race was always going to be a factor in Obama 's campaign , even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it . Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , his longtime pastor , making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense .

Survivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured . They say Metz stood him against a wall , walked up to him and shot him , execution-style , through the head . As his body lay on the ground , guards riddled him with bullets , according to survivors .

She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona , California , but has been hospitalized since mid-March . Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings , which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting , Thornton said . The next meeting is scheduled July 15 . Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison , which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law , and sent her request to the corrections department . The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment , discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation . The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court . The court , based in Los Angeles , can either grant or deny Atkins ' request .

Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home . A teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed . According to historical accounts of the murders , Atkins stabbed Tate , who was 8 1/2 months pregnant , and wrote the word \"  pig \"  in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband , director Roman Polanski . The following night , Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles . The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles . All of the killers remain behind bars . Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman . Atkins , like family leader Charles Manson , received a death sentence . Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state 's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972 .

The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years , according to Jon Peschong , who oversees the federal project at Hanford . \"  It was perfect work , ready to go for the stimulus package , \"  Peschong said . \"  Each day that passes the conditions worsen -LSB- and -RSB- the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner , years sooner . \"  The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford , including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation . Despite the dangers of his job , Gill said it came just at the right time . \"  I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world , -LSB- I -RSB- thought I 'd be there for 20 years , \"  Gill said . \"  We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant , -LSB- and -RSB- those jobs are n't jobs you just read the paper and get . \"  It is clear by watching Gill 's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford wo n't be decontanimated quickly . The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear . They break down contaminated equipment through a \"  glove box , \"  allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves . Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves , they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure . The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford . A report by Sens. John McCain , R-Arizona , and Tom Coburn , R-Oklahoma , listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted . The Hanford clean-up \"  has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress , \"  according to the report . Gerry Pollet , who runs a Hanford watchdog organization , says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste . But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed . \"  You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean-up and the environment , \"  said Pollet , who heads Heart of America Northwest . \"  They are picking the low-hanging fruit , the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities . But that does n't cost $ 2 billion . \"  Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up -LSB- to -RSB- happen with those dollars . \"  While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used , the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland , Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom . Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009 , which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn .

The experiment , dubbed \"  Aurora , \"  caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system . The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory . In October , the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability , but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled . A congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation 's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem . \"  It appears that they just made those numbers up , \"  Langevin said . \"  It is not acceptable . It is outrageous . \"  He said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks . The electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told CNN it regrets the confusion . Experts told CNN that Cooper Industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the Aurora vulnerability . The company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide . It has sold just over 100 , it told CNN . Langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps , and he will press to give those powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .

Although the county coroner 's office ruled that Wood 's death was an accident , others say the case has n't made sense . In 2010 , Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht 's back deck preceded Wood 's drowning . She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play . \"  I just want the truth to come out , the real story , \"  she said .

The movie 's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words : Lars von Trier . The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival -LRB- with \"  Breaking the Waves \"  and \"  Dancer in the Dark \"  -RRB- and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement 's so-called \"  Vows of Chastity . \"  It 's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film , and for a while , \"  Antichrist \"  compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices , not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman , neither of whom is named . The prologue -- the child 's death -- is a luxurious , slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex , black-and-white photography and baroque music , commingling with the infant 's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family 's washer-dryer . -LRB- There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg 's \"  Do n't Look Now , \"  a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural . -RRB- Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple . He 's an implacable rationalist , urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche . She 's not sure he 's ready to share that torment with her . Their bitter , sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing , pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman . Of course , when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail , their only weapons were words . Mindful that he 's up against \"  Hostel , \"  \"  Saw \"  and the like , Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably . Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife 's fears -LRB- it could be anywhere , but let 's imagine we 're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville -RRB- , the doctor 's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and , uh , worse . Much worse . It 's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top : \"  Chaos reigns ! \"  announces a fox , in perfect English , just as the movie goes off the deep end . Chaos reigns all right , and Gainsbourg 's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch . This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously , in my opinion . But this time the boot is on the other foot , and for once the charge seems to stick ; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe 's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance . Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently . When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago , the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I 've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery .

Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant , Siemionow said . Currently , cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue , Siemionow said . In the future , however , lifelong immunosuppression may not be required , she said . While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person 's own body , this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp , Siemionow said . Previously , three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China . The Chinese recipient , Li Guoxing , died in July of unknown causes , Guo Shuzhong , a doctor involved in the case , confirmed to CNN . One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face . The other French patient had been bitten by a dog . The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear . European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant , which would be the fifth in the world .

Yes , the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement , but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so , because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11 . This summer , as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson , the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers . One was an intimate acoustic performance ; the other a concert with his full band . He sang . He charmed . He won over staffers who never thought they 'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music .

In America , I 've had to explain Islam to other Americans , and abroad , I 've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world . Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world . For me personally , it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims . And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions . In his first steps as president , Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison , called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process , as special envoy for the Middle East .

During the vehicle 's early development period , these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer , but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision . AOL Autos : Minor damages , major repair costs \"  The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new , specific procedures and repair recommendations , \"  said Gerry Bonanni , Ford 's collision repair senior engineer . So , Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash , instead of having to replace the entire frame . \"  Partial-frame repairs cost at least $ 2,000 less than full-frame replacements , \"  says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"  totaled , \"  which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states . The success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center . A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang . \"  Previously , we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails , \"  says Bonanni . \"  But , by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies , we developed a procedure , which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers . \"  That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails , instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system -- which also translates into lower repair costs , and lower insurance rates , for the owner . \"  General Motors ' Collision Repair Test Center has had also had recent success on this front , says Jim Doherty , GM 's manager of the service-engineering team for aftersales body structures . \"  We coordinate with the product engineers , so as soon as a new vehicle starts development , about four years before it 's introduced , we engage with their team , \"  says Doherty . \"  Some of our people work on the structure , and some on the exterior , and we collaborate with the design engineers to work out whatever improvements might need to be made over the previous version of a component or assembly . \"  AOL Autos : Best & worst auto designs As with Ford , \"  the goal is to make sure that the vehicle has the most cost-effective repair strategy , \"  adds Dave Bakos , GM 's director of global after-sales mechanical engineering . \"  Our liaisons with people in the insurance industries are definitely useful -- they call us if they have concerns , and when we develop a new technology , we contact them to make sure they understand it . \"  The development of lighter-weight steel for auto frames also presents challenges to GM 's center .", "3ad31f0dd26f2dce06da1c10ced8d601bd5594c517": "The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan 's economy .", "08b1319d7a00848a21f3f90f8e2ee5e35d0b83cb1": "North", "3044ab905d466f1527cdaeac05558d21a0fc2ef58": "An Afghan political figure considered vital to peace efforts in the country was assassinated Tuesday , officials said .

Tell us below in the SoundOff box Kingsley says he has wanted to be associated with mainstream Indian film ever since he made \"  Gandhi \"  -- an Indo-British production and so not \"  entirely an Indian film \"  -- with director Richard Attenborough in India . The actor who is acclaimed for performances in \"  Sexy Beast \"  -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and \"  Schindler 's List \"  -LRB- 1993 -RRB- says he wanted to know what it would be like to work with an Indian director -- Leena Yadav , \"  who was amazing \"  -- and a huge Indian star like Bachchan . \"  I was very curious about him and he was very curious about me , \"  says Kingsley of working with 66 year-old Bachchan , or \"  Big B \"  as India 's most prominent Bollywood star is affectionately known to audiences . Bachchan 's deep voice and brooding persona changed the face of Hindi cinema in the 1970s . Up until then Bollywood screens had been populated by wisecracking loverboys -- the trademark Indian hero in the 1960s . Today , he is best-known for hosting the Indian version of \"  Who Wants To Be a Millionaire \"  -LRB- \"  Kaun Banega Crorepati \"  -RRB- . Kingsley says that while on set , he and Bachchan \"  circled each other like hunters . \"  Despite his respect for the Godfather of Bollywood , Kingsley refused to socialize with the star : \"  Because my character in this film is discovering Bachchan 's character and if it 's all frittered away in social ` bla-bla ' there 's nothing left to discover . \"  Kingsley 's Indian connection goes back even further than \"  Gandhi . \"  The British actor was born Krishna Bhanji to an English mother an Indian father and adopted his British name while at drama school .

In recent weeks a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants have killed scores of people in Afghanistan , including an assault on a military outpost Sunday that killed nine U.S. soldiers , as well as a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy a week ago that killed 58 people .

Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement , including in the incidents that the resolution cited .

The official said that the Pakistani government could also blame incidents in Pakistan , like recent attacks in Karachi and Hangu , on others . But without proof , he said , it would be irresponsible . Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous history that dates back several years .

We 're in a different position than some of our competitors , and we 're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance . Chetry : Right , but I 'm saying in the future , how are you guys guaranteeing that you wo n't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help ?

Fields : Well , consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now . The good news is , our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received . Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months . We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again . But getting that consumer confidence is really important . And that 's why today we 're announcing our Ford advantage plan , and it 's for any customer who buys a Ford , Lincoln or Mercury product , when they come into the showroom and buy their product , if that customer loses their position , we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they 're unemployed , to give them that peace of mind .

Kennedy . The move was deeply symbolic , not just for the public but also the party . The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy . Addressing race : Race was always going to be a factor in Obama 's campaign , even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it . Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , his longtime pastor , making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense . He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician . When Wright went further , so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church . All this time , black voters were rallying behind Obama , switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders , such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , had to do the same . Fundraising : Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors , Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976 . McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing , but the issue failed to resonate with voters .

A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton 's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November . McCain tried to exploit the Democrats ' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side , but the former rivals came together to stop that . Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity , epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation . The debates : Obama won all three debates in the eyes of the public , polling for CNN suggested , even if he came up with few , if any , memorable promises or knockout blows .

Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers . \"  The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , \"  Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail . \"  Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so . \"  ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham , who is representing Soeoth and Diouf , said , \"  It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... But here , it 's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . \"  Responding to Lieberman 's written questions , Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"  medical escorts \"  for deportation since 2003 . From October last year to the end of April this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . Of those , 33 detainees received medication \"  because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self , \"  she said . \"  First , I am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards , \"  Myers said . She added no detainee should be \"  involuntarily medicated without court order , \"  except in emergency situations . But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior . Soeoth , a Christian minister from Indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected . Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . See the document that shows Soeoth was injected \"  They pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection , \"  he said through broken English . He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles . Terminal Island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation . Soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness .", "64e309025dfcedc2ab9b47ac1957d49dd58cdb775": "Share your thoughts on Woods ' apology But other companies , including Nike and Pepsi 's Gatorade , continue to sponsor Woods , who has taken a break from his professional golfing career .", "9887f590abcb771589816f5771b1bb215c2b49ce0": "Andre Ward .", "082567ab0175dc93b84c8d1f57efafdbba338eb61": "Scott", "cf050fcb181715da14f7c6a017dda7ba54129dcf1": "Chaudhary , the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company .

County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth 's skull , according to project director Christopher Shaw . \"  The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper , \"  Shaw told CNN Thursday . \"  We do n't know just how smashed up it is , but it 's fairly intact because it 's a huge jacket we put it around . \"  The mammoth 's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"  tree-boxed \"  along with the surrounding dirt , creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact . Zed 's remains were encased in a plaster jacket . The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones . Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum , who began analyzing the various fossils in June , Shaw said . \"  It 's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years , \"  Shaw said .

He described it as \"  the most important discovery \"  for the museum \"  of the last 90 years . \"  Shaw said the announcement was made to \"  create interest \"  in the museum 's discovery .

Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville , the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States . Twenty-four elephants , most of them sick , old or abused , have lived at the sanctuary ; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants . It 's a place where elephants can roam freely , largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others , often after years living alone in captivity . But Buckley and Scott Blais , the nonprofit sanctuary 's co-founder , are very clear about what it 's not . The sanctuary is not a zoo . Visitors are n't allowed onto the property to view the elephants , and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year , in an effort to make the animals ' lives as natural as possible . \"  In order to accommodate the public , you would have to take away from the elephants , \"  Buckley said . \"  People have their own emotions , that energy , \"  Buckley said . \"  If you feel fear and they get close , they 're going to get hit with your energy . For Buckley , the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra . Studying to be a circus trainer , she bought the elephant , then just a year old , and trained her to perform . But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened , Buckley came to believe that captivity , particularly in a traveling circus , was no life for an elephant . \"  I did n't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit , \"  she said . \"  When you come to love elephants , when you really come to understand them and love them , you want more for them . \"  And when you learn how elephants live in the wild , it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants . \"  From years in the circus and in zoos , Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari , where they met Blais . It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born . \"  We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them , what they truly deserved , \"  Blais said . At the preserve , the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff . They share space with deer , wild turkey , raccoons , skunks and other native Tennessee animals . Life in a circus , and in most zoos , is abusive to elephants , highly intelligent and social animals who , in the wild , may roam dozens of miles in a single day , the pair said . Research has shown that elephants , like humans , can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions . Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary . \"  \"  Typically , when elephants are in captivity , they 're under a lot of stress , \"  Blais said . \"  Their entire life is abnormal ; it 's unnatural , and that can often lead to aggression . \"  Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space , and others will act out , just venting their frustrations , but it 's because of what captivity offers or what captivity does n't offer them . \"  The elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways : Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them , or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own , wanting a better life for the animals .", "66eacc6e17c3a85e882bd2b6933857dfff4f242a6": "Hakeemullah Mehsud", "1dd94dd767d0fe671d8414cb3107eac3b5cc052f6": "National Prosecuting Authority , disagreed .", "01d5b7cf16d87db5a2bed267d83aac584f58f3254": "Tim Kaine of Virginia , chairman of the Democratic Party , said \"  the case is closed \"  following Reid 's round of apologies .

In a 2006 interview with \"  Fox News Sunday , \"  Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen , but the order was never carried out because U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack . \"  I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since , \"  Clinton said in the 2006 interview . Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site , the republicansong.com , where he 's trying to sell copies of his song , \"  Please Do n't Vote for a Democrat . \"  The song goes beyond the national security issue , ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues , too . \"  They want to take the money from the hard workin ' man , and give it to the lazy folks that do n't give a damn , \"  Meehan sings . Another verse takes on the oil issue . \"  We 're not fightin ' for oil , we got plenty if we drill it , \"  he sings . The song 's not a moneymaker , he said , just an effort to recoup some of what he 's invested in the billboards . A copy of the song on CD cost $ 5 on the Web site , and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a \"  concert , party , meeting or event .", "d2bd01b09978961509b614542365e2b6f4c9f9da0": "Kapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979 , when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor .

Kapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"  Mr India , \"  which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans .

House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a statement he would work with Rep.

Lee Powell , director of the Mississippi Delta Grassroots Caucus said the boat provides economic opportunities . By docking and unloading nearly 200 passengers up to a dozen times a year , the Delta Queen helps to pump money into small cities along the heartland 's rivers that are not normally tourist destinations .

Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007 . The report from the U.N. 's Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006 . Despite Afghan security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said . Opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground . The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan 's gross domestic product in 2007 . InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year . According to the U.N. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers . The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade . Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001 . \"  Since drugs are funding the insurgency , NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys , \"  Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey . \"  Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban 's main funding source . \"  James Appathurai , a NATO spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade . \"  We share the U.N. 's concerns , \"  Appathurai told CNN . \"  Drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation . \"  He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly . \"  The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO , but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government , \"  Appathurai said . Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , Appathurai said . However , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand , poppy production was going on largely unchecked . According to the report , U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes . Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region .", "4390d330abd56b7e025171899f5b731888fb4ac20": "Coast Guard spokesman Henry Dunphy", "acba5782880c1a6842a3425d06e7d20025add0d99": "Warner was delivering the keynote speech at the convention , the slot that Obama himself filled four years ago .

The movie 's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words : Lars von Trier . The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival -LRB- with \"  Breaking the Waves \"  and \"  Dancer in the Dark \"  -RRB- and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement 's so-called \"  Vows of Chastity . \"  It 's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film , and for a while , \"  Antichrist \"  compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices , not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman , neither of whom is named . The prologue -- the child 's death -- is a luxurious , slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex , black-and-white photography and baroque music , commingling with the infant 's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family 's washer-dryer . -LRB- There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg 's \"  Do n't Look Now , \"  a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural . -RRB- Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple . He 's an implacable rationalist , urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche . She 's not sure he 's ready to share that torment with her . Their bitter , sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing , pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman . Of course , when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail , their only weapons were words . Mindful that he 's up against \"  Hostel , \"  \"  Saw \"  and the like , Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably . Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife 's fears -LRB- it could be anywhere , but let 's imagine we 're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville -RRB- , the doctor 's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and , uh , worse . Much worse . It 's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top : \"  Chaos reigns ! \"  announces a fox , in perfect English , just as the movie goes off the deep end . Chaos reigns all right , and Gainsbourg 's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch . This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously , in my opinion . But this time the boot is on the other foot , and for once the charge seems to stick ; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe 's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance . Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently . When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago , the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I 've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery . There also was a very vociferous walk-out : a gentleman who fairly barked \"  You get what you pay for , folks \"  as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end . That unhappy camper had a point . Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree , or he 's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that 's seen it all before and still demands more , more , more .

Most kidnappings are n't reported , he said , because the victims are generally smugglers , drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three . Other criminals targeted The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones . In some cases , a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment , but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom , which can be between $ 30,000 and $ 250,000 , Thompson said . \"  -LSB- The victims are -RSB- wearing the doper bling-bling , and they target them , \"  he said . \"  We 've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $ 1 million that the person has asked for . In addition to that , they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana , perhaps a pound or two of speed , a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin . \"  Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them , Burgett said . Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote 's patrons , known as pollos -LRB- Spanish for chickens -RRB- , Burgett said . Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country . See what other cities have a cartel presence There are rarely \"  true victims \"  in Phoenix 's kidnappings , the lieutenant said . However , one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"  uglier than the drug trade \"  and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes ' bidding when they ca n't come up with the ransoms . \"  In the drug business , the people getting killed are in the business . They are not end users , not consumers , \"  said Antonio Bustamente . \"  In the coyote business , the people killed are really innocent . -LSB- First-time -RSB- illegal entry is a petty offense . \"  Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix 's border-related violence , police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark . Girl mistakenly snatched On the evening of March 17 , 2008 , a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale . They were planning to play basketball . The friend , according to a police investigative report , was the niece of a man named \"  Chucky . \"  Chucky and his cohorts , witnesses told police , had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house . Hours later , the investigative report said , armed men arrived at Chucky 's sister 's house in three vehicles , one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use . The men wanted Chucky , their drugs or $ 24,000 . The 13-year-old said she did n't know Chucky . When she tried to walk away , \"  one of them grabbed her by the neck , pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle , \"  the report said . Eventually , the men called the girl 's mother to demand ransom . A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl . She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise . The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border , collateral damage is a reality . Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \"  The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence . The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him . On Andrade 's third day in captivity , an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $ 50,000 to $ 10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen . When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point , a Safeway supermarket parking lot , police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe , the report said . One of the men , Luis Alberto Castro-Vega , then 23 , disclosed Andrade 's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping .

His decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world . Average scraped together his last salary , some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked , and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor 's visa and bus ticket to Johannesburg . A friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up , leaving him stranded without a place to sleep . On Wednesday evening he walked into the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food . The church 's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 Zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries .", "f99fb23e7031d50818dfb62c398b4363250f02137": "warnings for all of England and much of Scotland and Wales for both Monday and Tuesday .", "ba0872b6fcb2e98fec0e8293a13278a0218e2aa95": "Jonathan Breeze", "34316427b674615310d5c487f5ed898cb2cc0b770": "Nicholas Negroponte", "b79a0f51a0833bf284a3064dc9cc2e8a1f7625154": "1990", "5cc7b8eccf5bc197f2fc10caa379989ed54647614": "Florida authorities were searching Sunday for a 33-year-old man after his wife and five children were found dead in their Naples home .", "280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d3342": "It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea 's capital when news of Kim Jong Il 's death filtered through . Though the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years , the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul , according to a journalist from the country 's largest newspaper . \"  The initial reaction was shock , quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next , \"  said Woosuk Ken Choi , assistant editor with The Chosun Daily . For its part , the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level , while the country 's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond . But Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm . North Korea : Should we fear change ? \"  There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food , \"  he said in an interview with CNN . \"  The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this . Many see the North Koreans as like us , people we need to care for and help . \"  Outright conflict is not something many would expect , he added . \"  There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting . \"  We 're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble . But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack . \"  Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time . \"  The architect of what became known as the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces , Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche , or self-reliance , which did much to foster the Communist country 's isolation . When Kim Jong Il , his oldest son , succeeded him , North Korea was crippled economically , having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed . Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime 's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy , U.S.-backed south . What military hardware does North Korea have ? But with Kim dead , Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor , perhaps even paving the way for reunification . \"  Most people , whether left or right on the political spectrum , hope this is the case , \"  he said . \"  However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification , citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s . \"  Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run . I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification . \"  But Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north . \"  Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict , as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service , \"  he said . \"  Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification , while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost . \"  If reunification is a pipe dream for now , Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north . \"  Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd , totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today , \"  he said . \"  But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it does n't matter whether it is third or fourth generation , they 're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation . \"  Another view , according to Choi , is \"  the Great Successor \"  will not last long . \"  He 's simply too young , \"  he said . Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s . \"  There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you wo n't last long . No matter how good he is , they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed . \"  As pictures of ordinary North Koreans mourning the loss of their Dear Leader continued to filter onto television screens across South Korea Tuesday , Choi felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed .", "769084f224ed8d05a4f689070eb0bd1cca1f19321": "touch", "219f36ec86b2212f8814df6fdffd30d8073b5cb80": "9 percent", "7e0da641ca5b2249a9ba9c39c6c8a47767bff5641": "Arnold and Klein", "db517018fe09f466933cfa6330be22487de63aba7": "July 25 .", "677375a4c69e81ab623af7c06a6b0a8d03d6350e17": "Chadian villages along Chad 's border with Sudan .", "ffd9898acbe737ca2b8864c332f89e27aeb85e608": "Brenda Holloway", "b84b5293335b7719e25ec0249b13ebce604bad9e5": "Wenger will receive an apology from the Premier Game Match Officials Board which appoints officials to top-flight games in England .", "eadcd5766bd5641bf333d58b2a7b52c53d6346d16": "Dalit", "d9eea0e631eac525f349c89eeb81826c65befa1d9": "Attorney General J.B.

Hyundai Steel 's Dangjin plant , which sits an hour and a half south of Seoul on the west coast , is the youngest steel plant in the world and has adopted new technologies to ensure it stand out from others . By simply enclosing storage and transport routes for raw material , they are able to prevent dust particles from entering the surrounding areas . The facility , which includes 35 kilometers -LRB- 21 miles -RRB- of conveyor belts fully enclosed and state-of-the-art storage domes , cost Hyundai Steel roughly $ 5.5 billion to build . The two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year . It is no small investment , but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time . \"  With the encapsulated storage system , we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $ 20 million a year -LRB- that we are saving -RRB- , \"  said Hyundai Steel 's senior executive vice president Cho Won-suk . Other steelmakers lose roughly 0.5 % in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open , subjecting the material to rain and wind , according to Hyundai . The idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant . Hyundai 's Dangjin plant , which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year , was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning . Dangjin also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials . The company says it recycles 100 % of its byproducts which supplies 80 % of the operation energy at the plant . \"  The byproduct gas contains energy and has some value .

Its tight relationship with its sister companies , Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction , is also enhancing its efforts to become more green .

Actually , certain things do translate -- tall , dark and handsome is still tall , dark , and handsome in the real world . But that aloof , secretive , and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show 's viewers ? Not easy to live with . Don Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things , like cheating repeatedly on his wife , Betty , and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her . But the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode . As with any TV show or movie , we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does , and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"  Mad Men \"  will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man . In real life , such life-changing revelations do n't always come . I dated a Don Draper-type for years . There were superficial similarities , like that they both worked in similar industries -LRB- just decades apart -RRB- and had a knack for always being \"  on . \"  Guys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons , but one of them is that they present themselves as calm , collected , and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others . In a business situation this comes across as professional , confident , and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly . In a real-life romantic relationship , the refusal or inability to \"  turn it off \"  can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved . At the same time , being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful . When you 're in love , having that power only makes you feel even more special . The Frisky : 10 things women do n't understand about men There are reasons why Draper 's wall is so high and impenetrable . Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him . There 's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior ! A man with secrets so big , he has to hide behind a wall all of the time . Betty Draper may not know Don 's secrets , but they do share a bond he does n't have with other people . The women he cheats with ? They do n't know him at all and they do n't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does . They 're not threatening to his persona , but she is . These are , of course , just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life .

I saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful , and I wanted more of it . It was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona . Similarly , Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for , like his support of Peggy Olson , his disinterest in Pete Campbell 's brown-nosing , his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season , and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett 's jaw .

She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised . The remains were identified through DNA testing , comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee . Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico , Virginia , for testing . The skull was found December 11 a half-mile from the home of Caylee 's grandparents , where the girl and her mother , Casey Anthony , 22 , lived before the girl disappeared . She was last seen in June . Casey Anthony faces charges including first-degree murder in the case . Watch a Nancy Grace video tribute to Caylee Anthony \"  Orange County Sheriff 's Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday that searchers at the site had found \"  significant skeletal remains \"  since the discovery of the skull . A \"  large percentage \"  of Caylee 's skeleton has been recovered , Garavaglia said Friday . The bones showed no sign of trauma before death . A child 's skeleton has many more bones than an adult 's , she said , and not all are fully developed . Some of the bones recovered are no larger than a pebble , she said . Watch the medical examiner discuss her findings \"  Garavaglia said the manner of Caylee 's death -- an opinion based on factors including an examination of the body and circumstantial evidence -- was determined to be homicide . Caylee 's grandmother Cindy Anthony was notified of the test results by the medical examiner 's office , Garavaglia said . Officials at the Orange County Corrections Department said Casey Anthony was notified of the results by a chaplain about 1:45 p.m. , per jail policy . One of Casey Anthony 's defense attorneys , Jose Garcia , entered the jail earlier , corrections officials said in a written statement . \"  Due to happenstance , not policy , attorney Garcia was not in the presence of the inmate when the notification was made , \"  the statement said . \"  We will not be commenting on the demeanor of inmate Anthony or her reaction to the news . \"  The Anthony family 's pastor , Thomas Shane Stutzman of Eastside Baptist Church , arrived at the jail about 2 p.m. but left 19 minutes later because Casey Anthony had refused his visit , as she was meeting with Garcia at the time , jail officials said . Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted . Prosecutors said this month that they will not seek the death penalty against her . Garavaglia would not disclose specific information regarding the remains other than to say they were completely \"  skeletonized . \"  Toxicology tests on the remains are pending , she said . \"  Our number one priority from day one was to locate little Caylee Anthony , \"  Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said . \"  We have stayed the course , and we will continue to do so until we have thoroughly completed our investigation into this tragedy . \"  The sheriff grew emotional while responding to a reporter 's question about the effect of the case on him personally . \"  Having a kid ...
